I [create][1], [run][2] and [participate][3] in a lot of technical conferences. My focus is on open source, and in particular [PostgreSQL][4]. I write frequently about the conferences I attend, and try to categorize that stuff under "[conference][5]". 

Conferences I've started: 

*   [Postgres Open][6]: a conference focusing on the business of PostgreSQL and disruption of the database industry
*   [Open Source Bridge][7]: My first blog post about Open Source Bridge.
*   [PostgreSQL Conference][8]: first of three conferences I organized before ending my involvement with the series. 

Ignite: 

*   [Ignite was fun, some links][9]: after my first ignite talk about surveys. Ugh - not my best talk!
*   [How to kill 4 chickens in 3 years][10]: My second ignite talk. It was pretty sweet
*   [How to unrig an election][11]: My third Ignite talk about how a group of people unrigged an election in Ondo State, Nigeria 

Giving Talks: 

*   [Training Lessions Learned: Code, Dojo, Whiteboards, Interactivity][12]
*   [Giving Good Talks presentation][13]
*   [Responding to offensive presentations at conferences][14]: More aimed toward conference organizers and participants 

Making Conferences: 

*   [Collaboration = conflict + people][15] 

Women's involvement (coding, conferences, speaking): 

*   [To Sir, With Love][16]: essay about women in tech that I wrote for O'Reilly
*   [Women who code: where are they?][17]
*   [What's changed? Portland as an example of increasing women's participation][18]
*   [What works? Getting more women involved in open source][19]
*   [Unlocking the clubhouse: cultural resistance and learning communities][20]
*   [Ada Lovelace Day: Professor Leah Buechley][21]: I met Leah on a trip to Boston for Libre Planet. She's awesome.
*   [A women-focused users group: the very, very beginning][22]
*   [Participation in open source: any worse than the rest of the industry?][23]
*   [It's not just Noirin][24]: A brief essay in response to an assault that occurred at a technical conference. 
*   [Getting ready for OSCON: code of conduct and cultural change][25] 

Portland and conferences 

*   [This year (2011) is so nuts for having conferences in Portland, OR][26]
*   [Event Organizers: Spaces to have tech events or conferences in Portland][27]
*   [This down needs...][28]: Beginning of three essays on the nature of tech community, growth in our industry and what we should really be working on to make Portland an awesome place for startups.
*   [Space and time to help our neighbors][29]: a short essay in response to a negative assessment of how the Portland tech community functions.
*   [We need vision and collaboration][30]: a short essay on the types of collaboration events we need in 

Portland Conferences and events I've helped organize: 

*   [Open SQL Camp][31]
*   [2010 Retrospective][32]: Mention of IgniteGov (the first ever!)
*   [October is a month of many conferences][33]: Mention of WhereCampPDX
