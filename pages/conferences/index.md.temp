I [create](http://opensourcebridge.org), [run](http://postgresopen.org) and [participate](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011/public/schedule/speaker/6486) in a lot of technical conferences. My focus is on open source, and in particular [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org).

I write frequently about the conferences I attend, and try to categorize that stuff under "[conference](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/tag/conference/)".

Conferences I've started:
