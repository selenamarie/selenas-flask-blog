Sunday's keynote at SCaLE was given by Stormy Peters. She talked about open source, business contributions and the social and financial economies driving development. 

Three of her research questions were: 

*   What is the initial motivation that encourages people to contribute?
*   How do companies pay for open source contributions? (and what's the effect?)

*   How do companies change projects when they join?

Her conclusion was that the developer community needs to teach businesses how to do things right for the community. We canâ€™t wait for businesses to figure it out on their own. The call to action was a good one, but it seemed to leave some audience members scratching their heads. One audience member asked, "How do we do that?" 

A few interesting figures she mentioned: 

*   1/3 of all developers believe that software should be free

*   Average number of open source projects a developer works on: 5

*   40% of open source developers are paid to contribute

*   10-20% are paid but their bosses donâ€™t know it  - that probably was a joke ;)

One quote that stuck with me was: â€œTypically people have been divided between left and right brain [professions].â€  I donâ€™t agree. I think you only have to look briefly at the history of science to see that creativity (â€œright brainâ€) and reason (â€œleft brainâ€) have often gone together.

The developer community just like many others - regular people who want to be useful, and inspired by their work. Creativity may not be asked for in a person's work. But people invent, dream and create regardless of whether their profession requires it.
