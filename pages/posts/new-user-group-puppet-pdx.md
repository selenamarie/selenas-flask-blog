Just a quick note that I'm helping start Puppet PDX and I posted some details [over here](http://blog.endpoint.com/2009/02/puppet-pdx-will-meet-on-22709.html).  Configuration management is awesome stuff, and if you live in the Portland area, you should come check out the new group.  We're meeting at Paddy's, 6pm on 2/27/09.
