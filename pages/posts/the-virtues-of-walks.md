I spent most of yesterday walking around with Scott.  We walked to the max and took it all the way to the Zoo. We stopped at PGE park, though for some bento. There is a trail, called the Wildwood, that goes from the Zoo down to the Japanese Garden.  It was muddy, and there were quite a few people out. After an hour or so in the garden, we took a bus back down to the max, stopped off at the Bike Gallery, and then caught a movie at the Fox Tower.  It was _letters from iwo jima_.  I hadn't heard much about it, other than it was the counterpart to _flags of our fathers_.  Wow, it was really good.
