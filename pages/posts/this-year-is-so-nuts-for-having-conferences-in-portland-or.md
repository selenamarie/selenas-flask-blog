**UPDATED! Just added Open Gov West! Rearranged, and just listing these all in order now. And added #140Conf in Vancouver, WA. It's close enough. :) And just added Digital Journalism Portland.**

For real.

This summer belongs to the nerds, geeks and hackers. I can't believe that Portland's tech scene got no love from [Portlandia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XM3vWJmpfo) this year. Thank heavens [they got a second season](http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/index.ssf/2011/02/portlandia_renewed_for_second.html)!

I did some research, and found **TWENTY** distinct conferences happening from now through November in the Portland area.

Anyway, there's a sweet new service that you might not have heard of called [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com), and a [quick search over there](http://lanyrd.com/places/portland/) revealed 20 conferences.
