Here are a few of the talks I've given recently here in Portland. I'm trying to give more talks locally, and happy to speak at your Portland User Group. Just drop me an email.

*   [How to get a job like mine](https://speakerdeck.com/selenamarie/how-to-get-a-job-like-mine). This talk was given to PSU students as an encouragement for them to get involved in free and open source software. Toward the end, we did a brainstorming session on the reasons why they didn't contribute, and tried to come up with projects each person in the audience might be interested in learning more about
*   [Command-line II](http://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-PDX/events/101680052/). I'm writing up my notes from this talk, hopefully to turn it into a real tutorial that others could copy. My goal this year is to give a tutorial every other week, and I'm hoping to have at least 10 lessons come out of that work. It seems like I need to give each lesson twice to really get the hang of it. Which means I aught to get out of this experience with 26 lessons... but trying to stay realistic about my time.
*   [Restores FTW](https://github.com/selenamarie/restores_ftw) at PDXPUG. This talk is about backups for PostgreSQL and how to get your teams to come up with restore plans that exercise databases as part of normal operations. I'm trying to switch talks about Backups to being talks about Restores. The next time I give this, I think I'll change the order of the "restore patterns" to be at the start of the talk, and the discussion about planning for backups/restores to the end. I plan to do a Mozilla brownbag that covers these topics and also goes through a live demo of backing up, restoring and testing PostgreSQL with the new 9.2 tools.
