It's a bit late for an "announcement", but [Gabrielle and I](http://baconandtech.com) are re-presenting the [User Groups](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2008/07/27/running-a-successful-user-group/) talk to the Portland Linux Users Group tonight. We're all about audience participation, and so we're going to focus on helping PLUG pick a few topics and presenters for upcoming meetings. And whatever else they want to talk about :)

Meeting starts at 7pm and here's where: 

Fariborz Maseeh College of Engineering & Computer Science Building
Room FAB 86-01 (This is in the basement.)
The building is on SW 4th across from SW College Street.
See location H-10 on map at [http://pdxLinux.org/campus_map.jpg](http://pdxLinux.org/campus_map.jpg)

Beer afterward at Jax!

Jax Bar And Restaurant
826 SW 2nd Avenue
