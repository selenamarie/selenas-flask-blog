Here's that article that I was reading yesterday about bikes in portland --

[http://www.statesman.com/life/content/life/stories/health/12/10/10bikeportland.html](http://www.statesman.com/life/content/life/stories/health/12/10/10bikeportland.html)

I thought these two quotes were interesting:

<span style="color:#0000dd;">
In 1971, Don Stathos, a Republican state representative angry that his grandchildren couldn't ride safely to school, penned the Oregon Bicycle Bill. That law set aside 1 percent of all state highway funds to build and maintain bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure.</span>

<span style="color:#0000dd;">In Portland, an estimated 5 to 6 percent of trips made each day are done by bicycle. City officials wants to boost that number to at least 15 percent.</span>
