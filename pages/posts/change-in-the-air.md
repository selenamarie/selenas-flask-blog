On Tuesday, I'm headed off to [PgCon](http://pgcon.org/), for three days of intense PostgreSQL conferencing. This conference is PostgreSQL's major developer (and end user!) conference of the year, held in Ottawa. I'm looking forward to seeing old and new colleagues, spending a day in the developer's meeting, and hopefully sharing some new projects. 

I'm also leading the charge on the [lightning talks](http://www.pgcon.org/2010/schedule/events/267.en.html)!  If you'd like to give one, find me at the conference, and we'll see what we can do.  

Finally, if you want up-to-date info about what's happening at the conference, have a look at my [twitter list for Postgres](http://twitter.com/selenamarie/postgres). (Right now, looks like we're trying to track down Oleg and Teodor in the #ashcloud!)

Also, today is my last day at [End Point](http://endpoint.com). I've really enjoyed my time working for a [fantastic PostgreSQL support company](http://www.endpoint.com/services/postgresql). I highly recommend their services - and two members of the team will be presenting at PgCon - [Greg Sabino Mullane](http://www.endpoint.com/team/greg_sabino_mullane) and[ Josh Tolley](http://www.endpoint.com/team/josh_tolley).

I'll be taking a new position next month, and really looking forward to a few new challenges. I'm definitely staying in Portland, and continuing to work with Postgres. 

If you're headed to PgCon, find me in Ottawa and I'll tell you all about it!
