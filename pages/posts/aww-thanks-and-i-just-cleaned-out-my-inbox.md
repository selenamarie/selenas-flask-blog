Thank you everyone who responded to my post over the last couple of days. It was overwhelming and awesome. I am grateful to have so many people that care about me, and who are working on so many fascinating, world-changing and difficult problems. 

I've tried to reply to everyone that sent me a personal note. 

While doing that, I realized that I've reached the end of what I can manage in my personal email, and have just completely cleaned out my inbox. Apologies to anyone that was expecting a response. Honestly, the likelihood that I would get to it without doing something drastic was approaching zero.

If I missed replying to you for some reason in the last few weeks, please resend your message. Or better, catch me on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/104248386338488302490) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/selenamarie).
