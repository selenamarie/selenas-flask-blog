Slides (as of this moment) are here: [Mistakes were made](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Mistakes-were-made-SCALE.pdf).  I changed quite a bit of the beginning and end, given how big the audience is. Previous talks, we've usually ended with a fun "omg, here's the craziest story I know" session. I imagine we'll get a little bit of that today.

Postgres folks will note a relevant picture on slide 13\. :)

This is my first keynote!  Thanks so much to SCALE for inviting me. There were at least 1500 registered attendees as of Friday, so looking forward to a big crowd.
