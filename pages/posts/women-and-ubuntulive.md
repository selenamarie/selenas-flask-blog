You have to look at the revision history to understand what is going on in this wiki entry. So, go ahead, go have a look.

Now, did you think, "What the fuck?"

I don't think the gender problems are going to magically go away today, but holy crap, could you lay off the shopping advice? First, why would any self-respecting shopper look to UbuntuLive for that information? And second, if you're going to title something "LinuxChix", do a google search first so that you're aware of the venerable organization by the same name and maybe link to it? And then read [Helping women in Computing](http://www.linuxchix.org/helping-women-computing.html) and [Why we refuse to just live with it](http://www.linuxchix.org/why-we-refuse-just-live-it.html).
