> Reading your article reminded me of the first technical conference I ever attended, and a woman I met who was among the first women trained by IBM to be computer technicians.> 
> 
> We had a small, and quiet BoF meeting and she waxed nostalgic about IBM way back then - using punch cards and how things had changed so much since she had taken her first mathematics class. She was so inspiring, hopeful and encouraging to the younger women who attended (I was only 20 at the time).> 
> 
> I agreed when you said  "it would be a huge help if the media provided more examples of male and female computer scientists who have interesting lives."  Thanks so much for sharing your experiences and successes.
