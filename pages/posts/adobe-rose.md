If you're ever in Sellwood on a Saturday afternoon - lunch at the Adobe Rose is really good. We had a salmon taco special and flautas. They also have margaritas that come in pint glasses, on the rocks. That was the main reason *we* went there, but I imagine the food would taste just as good without the tequila.
