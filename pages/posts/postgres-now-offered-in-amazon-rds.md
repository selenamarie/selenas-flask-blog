The cat is finally out of the bag! [Amazon Relational Database Service is offering PostgreSQL](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/11/amazon-rds-for-postgresql-now-available.html)!

This is an incredibly exciting development to have Postgres as easily deployable in AWS as MySQL, Oracle or SQL Server.

Would love to hear who is planning to try it out in the comments.
