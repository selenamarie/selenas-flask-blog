**UPDATE**: We've [already got at least one person interested in being a mentee](https://twitter.com/#!/geografa/statuses/77849821729394688), so go ahead and tag yourself as 'mentee', and we'll be in touch. :)

I made a quick little screencast for adding yourself as a potential mentor on the [ePDX.org](http://epdx.org) site.

We're cooking up a feature that will let mentors and mentees connect through this software, but we need a few intrepid beta testers to label themselves. 

To do join in, you need to add the 'mentor' tag to your profile. That's what the video above shows you how to do.

The idea driving this is that people wanting mentorship will have specific requests in mind, such as: 

*   Developer mentorship: "I'm learning Rails, and need someone to advise me on wedging Postgres into the ORM"
*   Business mentorship: "I'm starting a new business and need feedback for my business model and pitch."
*   Marketing mentorship: "I've got this awesome project, and I wish other people could see how awesome it is. Help!"
If you've got a sense of adventure, and would love to give your opinions about things to an impressionable, mentee-mind, [sign up today](http://epdx.org/sign_in)!
