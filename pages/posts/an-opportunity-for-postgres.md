I wrote up [my thoughts on the opportunities for Postgres](http://blog.endpoint.com/2009/04/being-at-mysql-user-conference-how.html) in light of the Oracle/Sun merger, and the response from our communities.

An excerpt: 

> As a developer and a sysadmin, my enthusiasm for Postgres comes directly from the people that work on the code. The love of their craft - developing beautiful, purpose-built code - is reflected in the product, the mailing lists and the individuals who make up our community.> 
> 
> When someone asks me why I choose Postgres, I have to first answer that it is because of the people I know who are involved in the project. I trust them, and believe that they make the best technology decisions when it comes to the core of the code.> 
> 
> I believe that there’s room for improvement in extending Postgres’ reach, and speaking to people who don’t already believe the same things that we believe: that conforming to the SQL standard is fundamentally a useful and important goal, that vertical scaling is an important design objective, and that consistency is just as important to excellent user experience as are verbose command names and syntactic sugar extensions.

Let me know what you think!
