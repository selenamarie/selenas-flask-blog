This is just a quick, very excited post about features in [Checkmarkable](http://checkmarkable.com).

We've done a bunch of new work this week! One of my favorites is embedding. 

You can create a publicly accessible checklist in Checkmarkable by giving it a Creative Commons license. Then you can share a link back to the list with your coworkers and friends. Or you can embed it. 

<script src="https://checkmarkable.com/embed/checklist/510.js" type="text/javascript"></script><noscript>[View the checklist &#34;Five Whys&#34; on Checkmarkable &rarr;](https://checkmarkable.com/u/54/checklist/510)</noscript>

For now, you can just view them remotely. But we've got other plans in store...

Enjoy!
