I've been filling my time with some community and open source work. 

First, I'm working with [Audrey](http://lifeofaudrey.com) and some other fabulous community members on [Calagator](http://calagator.wordpress.com), open-source calendar aggregation with teeth!  Our next codesprint is coming up on [February 2](http://calagator.wordpress.com/2008/01/20/next-codesprint-february-2/).  Everyone is welcome!

[Ignite Portland](http://www.igniteportland.com) is coming up on February 5, aka Super Tuesday. We're up to 400 RSVPs. I'm hoping for a rowdy, fun crowd.

The new PUGS site is coming along. I just got some patches to plug a wiki in there, and I got a pre-release of the PostgreSQL theme used by the Italian PostgreSQL site. Looking forward to digging in this evening. 

Michael Schwern's [geek2geek](http://www.geek2geek.info) has been a taking off.  I wrote a guest post about [the Pickup Artist](http://blog.geek2geek.info/2008/01/24/what-you-can-learn-from-the-pickup-artist/). We're riffing on the idea of social engineering, and the Pickup Artist focuses on manipulation and physical cues.  

Finally, I'm leaving for SCALE on February 8th. Lots too do before then!
