I have been looking into getting some woman-sized PostgreSQL shirts, in addition to the more typical men-sized tshirts. The particular style is [American Apparel shirts, style # 2102](http://store.americanapparel.net/2102.html). The shirt says 'PostgreSQL' in small print on the front, and has the big elephant logo on the back. We'll most likely ask for a $20 donation to the PostgreSQL non-profit for each shirt.

So, I'm conducting a small poll:

If you are interested in a woman-sized shirt, please email or comment on this thread with a quantity, and size (XS, S, M, L, XL). If you would not wear a PostgreSQL woman-sized shirt yourself, please consider whether you would maybe get one as a gift for someone else this holiday season :)

I would be overjoyed to have my mailbox clogged with requests, so please don't be shy!

I'm just trying to get a feel for the numbers, so your comment won't be considered an order. Also, please forward this to anyone you think might be interested.
