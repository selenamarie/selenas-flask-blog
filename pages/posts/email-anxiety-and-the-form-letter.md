I've struggled with my email since the birth of my baby. I've always struggled with email, to be honest. But now, I really don't have any extra time, and when I do have extra time, I don't want to deal with email.

In December and January, I got an unusually high number of requests for volunteer work, for sharing job postings and suggestions that I consider new positions. Some of these were easy to reply to, some I let hang in a "read but not really read" state in my inbox.

But, I decided a couple days ago to tackle the things still left and I determined that I was going to create a form letter to help myself say no to requests for me to volunteer my time more easily. There is more work for me to do on this note, and I still will edit it slightly if I know the person, or if there was something specific that I also needed to respond to. But I was able to send it and another form letter about ten times, making it a big time and guilt saver. 

The reason why form letters might help you has to do with [decision fatigue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue). I want to reduce the number of detailed decisions that need to be made, so that I reserve energy for time with my family -- where I am focusing most of my extra energy and creativity right now.

Here is the first letter for saying no to volunteer requests and responding to people I don't know who are asking for me to share a job posting: 

> Your project seems very worthwhile! I unfortunately don't have time for additional volunteer work at this time.
> 
> My current volunteer engagements include:
> 
> [Python Software Foundation](http://python.org/psf) Director <psf-board@python.org>
> [Ada Initiative](http://adainitiative.org) Advisory Board <info@adainitiative.org>
> [USENIX LISA 2015 program committee](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15)
> [PyLadies](http://pyladies.org) Organizing Team <pyladies@python.org>
> Major Contributor to [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org) <pgsql-general@postgresql.org>
> 
> If what you're working on seems like a good fit for one of those organizations, please feel free to contact them at the email or web address above.
> 
> I only forward requests for paid labor on to advisory boards and colleagues. If you've asked about a paid position, I've forwarded your message along and will be in touch if someone in my personal circle responds.
> 
> My favorite recruiter if you're seeking to hire someone in Portland, OR is Aimee Levens <imprintpdx@gmail.com>.
> 
> Thanks again for getting in touch and I'm sorry I can't be of more help at this time.

The key elements for this email were: 

* A positive statement that thanks the sender for the effort they put into their email
* A list of possible volunteer organizations they can contact that I support
* A couple caveats for common requests related to volunteer work - a big request being recruiting
* A suggestion for a great recruiter in Portland. 
* A final thank you

I also wrote a form letter for job pitches that I use as a base that I can customize. And I have a template for responding to typical Postgres community questions I receive.
