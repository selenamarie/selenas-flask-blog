Thank you all who participated in the PL/Summit. We spent about 5 hours together for discussions about PLs, and then a few more hours at the pub.

Also, thank you to [Dan](http://langille.org) who supported the meeting and provided pizza. And thanks to [SPI](http://www.spi-inc.org/projects/postgresql/) for funding travel for several hackers that could not have made it to PgCon otherwise.

The rough notes from the meeting are at:

I put a few TODOs out there based on discussions, and for a reminder to myself to follow up with folks that had good ideas.

Here's the TODOs:
* Publish code for PL/NULL - Tim
* Make a list of all the boilerplate code - Selena will send email to -hackers about it
* Set up a 1/2 day meeting at the next pgcon - Josh Berkus
* Set up a Skype session in a few months time to go over progress - Selena (Tim, Alvaro agreed to attend)
* Further discussion of DDL triggers - Jan Wieck
* Further discussion of permission system - Steve Singer
* Further discussion of per-statement config parameters for things like timezone - Jan Urbanski
