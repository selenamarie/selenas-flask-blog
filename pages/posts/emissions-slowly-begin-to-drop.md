Source: GreenBiz.com
WASHINGTON, April 17, 2007 -- In the EPA's annual national greenhouse gas inventory, the agency has found that overall emissions during 2005 increased by less than one percent from the previous year.

The drop follows a steady increase over the last 15 years, when greenhouse gases climbed 16 percent between 1990 and 2005.

The Department of Energy reports that greenhouse gas emissions have risen an average of 1.2 percent per year each year.
