> The new Harper's (June 2007) contains a stunning and powerful â€œNotebookâ€ essay titled â€œClimate, Class, and Claptrap,â€ by Garret Keizer -- a minister, if I recall correctly. Keizer writes as well as Wendell Berry, but with a kind of righteous anger that the more ponderous Berry tamps down. This essay is about the contradictions inherent in the environmental community's fast embrace of â€œgreen capitalismâ€ and wondertoys.
