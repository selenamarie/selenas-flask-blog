I just finished updating the [Talks](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/talks/) page for [PostgreSQL Conference Fall 2007](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/). There are so many great folks giving talks -- [Neil Conway](http://advogato.org/person/nconway/diary.html?start=42), [Josh Berkus](http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/database/soup), [Robert Treat](http://people.planetpostgresql.org/xzilla/), [David Fetter](http://people.planetpostgresql.org/dfetter/) and Robert Hodges are all flying in. It'll be great to see Josh, Robert and David again!  I'm excited to meet Neil and Robert, both of whom I've heard great things about. 

PDXPUG will be represented by Mark Wong and [David Wheeler](http://www.justatheory.com/). Mark will be talking about performance, building on a talk he gave last year to PDXPUG on [performance and TPC benchmarks](http://pugs.postgresql.org/pdx/archives/2006_11.html). This conference talk will be focused on practical tools one can use with PostgreSQL. David's talk will be about his recent work with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. David was kind enough to give PDXPUG's very first talk, about [PL/PgSQL](http://pugs.postgresql.org/pdx/archives/2006_07.html). 

We also have Webb Sprague from Eugene, OR coming out to talk about PostGIS. We're hoping to get him out for user group meetings some time. Eugene is about two hours away from Portland, so we occasionally have visitors (hi Andrew!) to PDXPUG and PerlMongers from there. And of course [Joshua Drake](http://www.commandprompt.com) will be there.  

Another great thing about having this conference at PSU is that members of the [database reading group](http://datalab.cs.pdx.edu/dbrg/) folks will be sure to attend. And our favorite [relational algebra teachers](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2007/09/21/relational-algebra-talk-last-night-was-awesome/) will certainly be there. 

As of today, we've almost filled up our event space! So if you haven't registered yet, [register now](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/#register).
