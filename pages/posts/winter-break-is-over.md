Sadly, my winter vacation is over. I needed a couple weeks to recharge after a crazy year of wrapping up old stuff (finally done with the ERP project) and starting lots new things ([Legion of Tech](http://www.legionoftech.org), [PostgreSQL Conferences](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/2007/), my first cyclocross race!). 

If you're interested in more about me, you can check out my profile at [Portland On Fire](http://portlandonfire.com/selenadeckelmann), a new project from Raven Zachary about Portland residents. Raven is planning to profile a new person every day this year. I'm January 6\. 

Also, don't forget about [PostgreSQL Conference East.](http://www.postgresqlconference.org) Registration will open this week!  The [call for papers](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/talk_submission/) will be open until February 3, 2008\. I've got my work cut out for me arranging all the details from here, but I'm looking forward to working with some great community members out in College Park, MD. 

I'm giving a talk on January 17th, titled "10 new things you can use in PostgreSQL version 8.3". Last week, I felt like [PDXPUG](http://archives.postgresql.org/pdxpug/) was running itself -- we've got the next six months of talks lined up already. I'll be publishing our calendar over on the [PDXPUG blog](http://pugs.postgresql.org/pdx) tomorrow.
