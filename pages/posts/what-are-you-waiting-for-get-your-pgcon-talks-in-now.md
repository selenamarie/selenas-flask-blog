Like [Josh Berkus](http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/database-soup/) said [yesterday](http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/database-soup/submit-to-pgcon-29129): 

> As of today, you have 2 weeks left to submit talk proposals to [PGCon](http://pgcon.org/).> 
> 
> You know you want to. [PGCon](http://pgcon.org) is _the_ international conference for PostgreSQL hackers, sysadmins, application developers, SQL geeks and other Smart People. Submit your talk! Be a Smart Person too!> 
> 
> [PGCon](http://pgcon.org/) will be happening May 21-22 in Ottawa, Canada, with tutorials on May 19 and 20\. Some financial help is often available for speakers, but none is available for non-speakers. So [submit](http://www.pgcon.org/2009/submissions.php), [submit](http://www.pgcon.org/2009/submissions.php)!> 
> 
> We particularly could use some talks on the new 8.4 features, really creative PostgreSQL applications, massive Postgres scaling, PostGIS, BioPostgres, and a few case studies. This means you.

I attended [PgCon](http://pgcon.org/) last year for the first time. Not only were the presentations top notch, but [Dan Langille](http://dan.langille.org/)'s hospitality set the groundwork for yet another fantastic community-building experience PostgreSQL community members experienced during the [2006 Anniversary summit](http://conference.postgresql.org/) in Toronto, again in [2007](http://www.pgcon.org/2007/) at the first PgCon. 

We had plenty of outstanding socializing and hacking opportunities. Last year's conference started with a gathering of committers that was fodder for great pub and hallway track conversation all week.  Great talks I saw included Andrew Sullivan's [Idle thoughts on PostgreSQL Project Management](http://www.pgcon.org/2008/schedule/events/85.en.html), Greg Sabino Mullane's [Bucardo](http://www.pgcon.org/2008/schedule/events/93.en.html) talk about this multi-master replication tool, and Magnus Hagander's walk through how [search.postgresql.org](http://www.pgcon.org/2008/schedule/events/75.en.html) was implemented.

Ottawa was beautiful last year, and I can't wait to go back this May!
