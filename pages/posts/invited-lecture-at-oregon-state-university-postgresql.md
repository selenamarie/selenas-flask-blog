Oregon State University invited me to give a technical talk yesterday about PostgreSQL and open source community. It was aimed at graduate level students, and an attempt to recruit them. 

It's not in the slides, but I told a short story in the 'but there's a disconnect' slide. I wanted to convey to them that both the free and open source community and the educational system are failing them when it comes to open source. I attended a conference last fall that had nearly 1000 undergraduate and graduate students. I staffed a booth about open source software, and [nearly every student that dropped by couldn't think of a single open source project they'd ever heard of](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2010/10/01/thoughts-on-grace-hopper/). With prompting, they'd agree that Linux was probably open source.

We had a discussion about how our community manages conflict, who the big production users of PostgreSQL are, and how folks can get involved. I gave out a few tshirts and buttons, and [ran into some old friends](http://twitter.com/#!/cmartin0/status/34784598567161856) from Open Source Bridge.
