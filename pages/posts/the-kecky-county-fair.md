Yesterday, our friends Becky and Kate had a county fair on the street in front of their house. There were more than 30 entries to the judged crafts which included: pies, baked goods other than pies, canned food, sewing and needlepoint, livestock (bees and chickens!), gardening and "other". The "other" category included a cow sculpture made of butter.

Here was my entry:

![I am not a douche bag](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/dsc_0047.jpg)

I embroidered "I am not a douchebag" on the back side of the bag. I forgot to take a picture of it before I gave it away to a person who really wanted it.

What a great party!  I can't wait for next year.
