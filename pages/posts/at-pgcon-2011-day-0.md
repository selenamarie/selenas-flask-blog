I wrote my review of synchronous replication over on [Emma’s Tech blog](http://tech.myemma.com) (It'll probably be published mid-day Tuesday). I’m visiting Ottawa this year on behalf of [Emma](http://www.myemma.com), one of many great sponsors of Postgres’ yearly international developer conference, [pgCon](http://pgcon.org). 

This week will be packed for me - attending the [Clustering summit](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PgCon2011CanadaClusterSummit), the developers meeting, [presenting about Emma’s database systems](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/events/366.en.html), leading the lightning talks, and of course attending the many parties this week.

Because we are spread so far around the globe, pgCon is often our one chance to get together and really dig into problems in-person.

And, I’m pulling together our first ever [Procedural Language summit](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/events/374.en.html). With the new extension system, over 30 procedural languages implemented, and a ton of new features being added to existing PLs, I thought it was time PL developers should come together and have a chat. I’ve still got a few details to work out before Saturday (sorry all that RSVP’d - final agenda coming soon!). 

I’m hoping to also have another, unrelated, announcement this Wednesday. Hopefully all the details come together!

Anyway, with that cliffhanger, I’m off to get a good night’s rest before the clustering summit tomorrow.
