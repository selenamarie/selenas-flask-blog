Remember [that class](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2011/02/10/offering-an-intro-to-postgresql-class/) I announced about a month ago? 

Well, it's happening for real. We're starting March 7th and going for 6 weeks. [Sign up now](http://codelesson.com/courses/view/introduction-to-postgresql) if you're want to join us for this first edition of the class.

I'm planning to do screen casts for a lot of the content, and have just started playing around with [Screenflow](http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/overview.htm). 

The first couple weeks are primarily about using psql and learning key features of PostgreSQL, with some history sprinkled in. The next two weeks dive into features like: full text search, built-in functions, our many datatypes, indexing and transactional DDL. I'll be surveying students as we go along to add detail where I can on key features they're interested in.  The last few weeks go into administration, maintenance and configuration. I'll also be throwing in details about the PostgreSQL community - people, the best places to go for help, and hopefully some cameos from Postgres community members.

So, don't forget to [sign up today](http://codelesson.com/courses/view/introduction-to-postgresql)! Especially because this pudding says so:
