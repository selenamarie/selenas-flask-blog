Oops, this got published early.  I'll be updating this shortly.. probably over lunch.

Summary of last night: 

We had a great time last night at the pub for registration, and then over to the Yahoo! party. We had fun talking databases, beer, and the difficulty in trying to understand Australian accents. I learned from Tom (not Tom Lane) that Adelaide, Australia has a fantastic wine-growing region. Alvarro once again recommended that Jeff commit his time interval data type.  I think Jeff was convinced to do this for 8.4\. Now I have to update the documentation!
