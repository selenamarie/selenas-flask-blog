So, I'm on the committee for MySQL Conf this year, and the committee is specifically seeking talks about PostgreSQL. The idea is to broaden the scope of the conference to include a lot of different open source database technology, including a bunch more about Postgres.

The theme of the conference is "the ecosystem and beyond", which was chosen specifically because the open source database world has exploded and grown so much in the last three years. Below is a slide from a presentation I made last year at LinuxConf AU about the growth in free and open source (FOSS) databases:

 We've seen a half-dozen forks of MySQL appear, exponential growth among "NoSQL" databases, and now, a powerful release from PostgreSQL.  It may seem odd that the name of the conference didn't change to reflect the change in focus - but this is the largest FOSS database conference I know off - weighing in at over 2000 people last year. Given the community that's grown around it, I understand why they are keeping the name.

The content will still largely focus on MySQL -- the core, the many forks, and the community around it. But we'll also hear from many new, successful database projects, and definitely hear from PostgreSQL.  To do that, though, I [need you to submit talks](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011/public/cfp/126)!

The submission deadline for all proposals is **October 25, 2010**!

Topics for consideration include:

*   Innovative uses of Postgres

*   Data warehousing and BI

*   Architectures based on Postgres

*   PostGIS

*   Government + Postgres

*   [your favorite web framework] + Postgres

*   Performance and optimization

*   Security and database administration

*   "In the cloud"

*   Business and case studies

If you've got an idea, [submit a proposal today](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011/public/cfp/126)!

Please contact me directly for feedback, help with submissions or help generating ideas.  And if you're submitting, please just drop me a line to let me know! I'd love to hear from all that are interested.
