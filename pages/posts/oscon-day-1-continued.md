I also saw Larry Wall's Perl 6 talk - i need to look up implicit list comprehension and DFA/NFA regex syntax. Lots of neat stuff, I wish Perl 6 were coming sooner.

Luke Kanies also gave a talk about Puppet. I thought it was great, but heard some negative stuff about it from someone else. I'm going to give it a try, but cfengine is my fallback plan.
