Today, I start at [Emma](http://myemma.com/).

I have some clues about what I'll be up to - working on some big PostgreSQL databases, tearing into the infrastructure and discovering what makes their small company tick. Emma's work with small businesses, and a focus on humane communication and consensus building completely drew me in.  

And I'm looking forward to riding my bike everyday over on the office on Burnside!
