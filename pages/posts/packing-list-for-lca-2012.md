I leave in two days for [Linux Conf AU](http://linux.conf.au/), in Ballarat, Australia! This is my second LCA, and I've given talks internationally at least 10 times. For the past six months, I've used a short checklist to help make sure I don't miss the important things (ticket, passport, underwear!). 

Today, I took a little more time to prepare and share what I'm taking with me.

This is based on [Tantek's SXSW Packing List](http://tantek.com/2011/061/b1/sxsw-packing-check-list). I share this list under [Creative Commons 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).

Caveats: 

*   I generally do not wear jeans or slacks to conferences, and when I do, my pants do not have pockets. They're bulky, uncomfortable on long flights and, frankly, don't look as good as a skirt. So, I've adjusted some of the stuff in the list for that wardrobe choice.
*   I generally do not wear t-shirts to conferences I speak at.
*   I am going without a smartphone at the moment. My last one was stolen in a Vancouver, BC coffee shop in early December 2011\. I've taken it as an opportunity to simplify, and so far, I feel better.

## Night before

Lay out your outfit for the next day.

*   **Underclothes (bra, underwear), socks and a tank-top slip.** - I found these Dynamic nylon/spandex slips that go under sweaters and dresses. Super versatile, cheap ($16?) and look great. Having trouble finding them online, but [Sloan](http://www.sloanpdx.com/) sells them in Portland.
*   **Dress** - Something simple that will be comfortable on the plane, like this [Urban Outfitters knit drape dress](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=22695720).
*   **Leggings** - black, probably bring two pair and again, these look great under a dress or sweater and can be taken off when you transition from 30F to 30C weather. I found the best value fleece leggings at [Ipnosi](http://g.co/maps/eunj9).
*   **Boots** - black, zippered are my favorites. I'm going to another conference immediately after LCA back in the US, so I need something other than sandals for the trip.

## Backpack

*   **A backpack** - I have a [NorthFace Surge](http://www.ebags.com/product/the-north-face/surge/152265?productid=10143698) (have had three of these). They will often dip below $100 in certain colors. The laptop area is a little big for the Air, but overall, this is a solid, spacious pack. I've put 10 days worth of stuff for a conference and holiday in Japan with this pack. Has a nice bonus pocket in the bottom and useful double zipper on the front for stuffing random documents and quick access to a Kindle, a few inner pockets for separating tools, pills and etc..

Here's all the stuff that goes into my backpack!

### Essentials

*   **Passport and Visa (if necessary)** - And you might need a Visa where you're going, so check before you leave! A [visa for a 3-month trip to Australia](http://www.eta.immi.gov.au/) is usually fast and easy.
*   **Wallet** - I bring ID, I try not to bring keys with me since my neighbors have keys and my husband picks me up and drops me off at the airport.
*   **Ear plugs** - Essential for dorm accommodations and getting stuck in airports.
*   **Small, unlined notebook** - I doodle, and leave notes for people. Nice if there are perforated pages in the back so that the binding of the book doesn't fall apart after ripping out pages.
*   **Pens and a pencil** - Pencil is more durable in the rain (hail, Portland!)
*   **[Burts Beeswax Lip Balm](http://tantek.com/asin/B00012NDH4)** - Planes and hotels are so dry!
*   **Small bottle of lotion** - Washing hands and filtered air ends up leaving my face and hands chapped.
*   **Small Camera** - I have a Canon Elph. Bring an extra SD card in case your existing one goes corrupt!
*   **e-reader** - I have a Kindle, but any e-reading device will do. I'm bringing [Liespotting: Proven Techniques to Detect Deception](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312611730/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tendthegard-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0312611730) as my research project for the flights.
<li>**Book** - I'm also bringing a [The Graveyard Book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060530944/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tendthegard-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0060530944) for taxi-ing and lift-off. A thick newspaper might also work here.
*   **US-based Phone** - I currently have an LG-VX5600 with no data plan on Verizon. I pay $10/mo on a family plan that has something like 300 texts and supports at least 300 minutes per person.
*   **Laptop** - I've got a 13" Air. Loving it so far.
*   **Music storage device** - maybe an iPod/iTouch.
*   **A paper envelope** - for storing receipts and stray bits of paper with notes.
*   **Ziplog bags** - for liquids getting through the airport, packing away nicknacks, temporary storage for food, an easy water cup and dealing with anything that might explode in transit.
*   **Handmade bags and enclosures for tech gadgets** - I made two pouches to hold cables, devices and power converters. I hate having lots of stray items rolling around in bags. This helps me not lose things and maintain a little more order. Having a sewing machine makes this easy - I made two items last night for the trip! :)

### Secondary contents

*   **Ocular backup** - I talked my eye doctor into giving me a set of disposable contacts for last-minute scuba dives or impromptu 2-6am clubbing where glasses would just be silly. I also always bring a spare pair of glasses and my prescription.
*   **Unruled pad of paper** - For taking notes in sessions and bigger sketching
*   **Energy bars** - two or three for the plane. I prefer Clif bars and Lara bars. [Builder bars](http://tantek.com/asin/B000FAD8G8) (20g of protein!) are good if you're going to have a series of breakfasts that are all carbs.
*   **Peppermint gum** - coffee, carbs == bad breath
*   **Hat** - Good for runs in hot, sunny weather, or instant camouflage in crowded rooms.
*   **[Anker Astro2 8400mAh External Battery](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0067UPRQ4/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tendthegard-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0067UPRQ4)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tendthegard-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0067UPRQ4)** - Includes a **flashlight**. Great for charging any of your devices and making friends.
*   **[John's Phone](https://www.johnsphones.com/)** - a simple phone that can be used most anywhere. Doesn't support texting, which may be an issue. :) It's a quad-band phone that supports 2G / GSM 850-900-1800-1900 Mhz. The only things it *doesn't* support are pure 3G and CDMA networks. My plan is to get a Telstra SIM at the airport when I arrive. Suggestions welcome.
*   **Ethernet cable** - the dorm rooms at LCA in ballarat don't have wireless.
*   **earbud headphones**
*   **Small laptop/shoulder bag** - A tiny bag to just carry your laptop. Much more convenient in the evenings and brunches.
*   **[Universal power adapter](http://amzn.to/xeRXs3)** - I've used this particular model in five countries. I can't say that it's my favorite - if I had thought about it earlier, I would have gotten [an AU power converter plug](http://amzn.to/zKpQtD) a couple weeks ago!
*   **Sandals** - something to change into after landing in warm weather!

## Carry-on bag

I use an [eBags Motherlode eTech Mini](http://www.ebags.com/product/ebags/mother-lode-etech-mini-21-wheeled-duffel/68256?productid=837488). I've had three of them, and the worst part is eventually the zipper dies. They have a lifetime warranty policy, but I travel enough that I've just bought a new bag rather than wait for a repair. But I'll be testing that next month when I'm home for a while. :)

### For the carry-on

*   Empty **Water bottle + carabiner** - so important when you're in dry, air conditioned climate for weeks.
*   **Energy bars** - I take about 2 per day of the trip
*   **[Stain remover](http://tantek.com/asin/B000BGK968)** - Great suggestion from Tantek, and essential when you're on the road perpetually.
<li>**Woolight liquid detergent** - great for hand-washables and dry-clean-only dresses. And way cheaper than $200 to get five days of clothes cleaned in a hotel laundry.
*   **[Sunblock](http://tantek.com/asin/B0013OFRUK) and swimsuit** - Always bring a suit regardless of the weather. Nice bottom layer in a pinch.
*   **[Fleece pants](http://tantek.com/asin/B003ILA8UA)** - excellent for sleeping and laundry day while travelling.
*   **Pumas** - pair of walking/running shoes for any occasion.
<li>**6 pairs underwear, socks** - and however many bras are appropriate
*   **Workout gear** - depends on your body type, but I bring 2 sport-bras, short fast-drying yoga pants and a fast-drying technical top. Much easier to clean than cotton. In unfamiliar or cross-country terrain, I bring a separate pair of running shoes and a plastic bag to protect everything else from the dirt.
*   **2 dresses, 2 skirts, 1 pair pants, 4 tops, 1 sweater** - enough outfits for three talks, a keynote and an evening out!
*   **Lip gloss, lipstick and eyeshadow** - I stick with a Shiseido slightly-sparkly lip gloss, MAC red lipstick for evenings and a black/white combo eye shadow. I use the black for eye liner and the white for accents.
*   **Bathroom kit** - includes: toothbrush, toothpaste, brush, shaver, nail clippers, face moisturizer, deodorant, hair product, vitamin C, advil and a multi-vitamin.</strong>

## Tech pre-work

*   Set up a perma-logged in IRC session for yourself. I use [irssi](http://irssi.org) in a [screen](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-gnu_screen/) session on a cloud-hosted virtual machine.
*   Set up [bitlbee](http://bitlbee.org) to login to your IM in the same session. This is awesome for people who don't use IRC leaving you notes while you're offline.
*   Check out the wiki for any events shaping up and add those to your calendar or TripIt plans.

## Print your boarding pass

24 hours before your flight, be sure to:

*   Log on to your airline's website
*   check-in online
*   print your boarding pass
*   put it in your backpack

## Night before

*   Collect devices and chargers: phone, Kindle, laptop, usb power supply. Maybe also tablet. Pack spare batteries in checked luggage.
*   Confirm in wallet: enough US cash for two meals, credit card, debit card, identification. If you have status on an airline, bring the card for cutting in line.
*   Confirm how you're getting to the airport, and the time you need to be there.
*   Confirm how you're getting from the destination airport to your hotel or first stop.

## Morning of

*   Shower and put on clothes laid out the night before
*   Put: laptop, kindle, phone, notebook, keys, any reading material, wallet and IDs in carry on. Include:

    *   power cable(s) and supply(s),
    *   video adapter(s) connected to your external monitors
<li>Arrive at airport 90 minutes early
*   Join the #lca.conf.au IRC channel

Have a great flight!

## Landing

*   **Pick up a SIM for your phone** - for Melbourne, that's at the nearest Telstra store, and there's one in the airport.
*   **Take public transit into town** - There's almost always a bus or train that will take you into the downtown of a major city. Melbourne has a skybus that leaves every 10 minutes from the terminal right into downtown!

And your adventure begins! :)
