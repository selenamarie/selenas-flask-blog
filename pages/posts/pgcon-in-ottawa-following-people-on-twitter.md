I'm in Ottawa at PgCon and listening to Bruce Momjian give the keynote.

We have a few people who've joined Twitter in the last couple months and are posting their thoughts through the conference.  Try following @[crad](http://www.twitter.com/crad), @[fuzzychef](http://www.twitter.com/fuzzychef), @[franciscojunior](http://www.twitter.com/franciscojunior) and @[selenamarie](http://www.twitter.com/selenamarie) (me) for our up-to-the-minute updates!

I'll be giving a lightning talk this afternoon around 5:30pm about user groups and PostgreSQL.
