Many thanks to all the community members who have submitted fantastic proposals to [Postgres Open ](http://postgresopen.org)so far. 

We've decided to [extend the submission deadline](http://postgresopen.org/2012/speaker/) by 1 week, closing July 3, 2012 at 11:59 pm.

Have a [look at our CFP](http://postgresopen.org/2012/blog/2012/06/11/2012-call-proposals-open/) and [submit a talk](http://postgresopen.org/2012/speaker/)!  

Hope to see you in Chicago this fall.
