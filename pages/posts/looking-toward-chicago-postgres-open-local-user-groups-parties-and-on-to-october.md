I've been incredibly busy this past month, and not blogging - [being a free agent](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2011/07/12/shaking-the-etch-a-sketch/) has possibly made me busier than I was before!

[Postgres Open's schedule](http://postgresopen.org/2011/schedule) is in near-final state. We've started adding talks to our Demo room on Thursday, and are looking forward to a [keynote from Charles Fan, SVP at VMWare](http://postgresopen.org/2011/schedule/presentations/1/) about recent developments in vmware's cloud offerings for Postgres. 

We'll also be getting a more in-depth look at Heroku's new [postgres.heroku.com](http://postgres.heroku.com) on-demand database service, as well as an open source tool they wrote called [WAL-E](http://postgresopen.org/2011/schedule/presentations/87/).

Thanks to Heroku, we'll be streaming much of the content from the conference live, so you'll be able to catch the keynotes and many of the talks, even if you're not there. And we'll be sharing the videos after. 

I believe we're the first Postgres conference to do this! Someone correct me if I'm wrong. :)

While I'm in Chicago, I'm planning to [drop by the Windy City Perl Mongers](http://www.meetup.com/Windy-City-Perl-mongers-Meetup/events/31544172/) for a [reprise of my 9.1 talk from OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/19275).

We're also planning a couple parties for Postgres Open, and hopefully inviting a few of the local user groups to join us. 

After that, I'm headed in October to PostgreSQL Conference EU, and will be giving a talk about [terabyte Postgres databases](http://www.postgresql.eu/events/sessions/pgconfeu2011/session/152-managing-terabytes/) (and the problems you run into with them), and a [database-specific "Mistakes were Made"](http://www.postgresql.eu/events/sessions/pgconfeu2011/session/150-more-mistakes-were-made/) talk, about operations and the tools we need to use to help us make fewer mistakes.
