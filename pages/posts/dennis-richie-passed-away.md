I heard today that [Dennis Richie passed away](https://plus.google.com/u/0/101960720994009339267/posts/ENuEDDYfvKP). 

I have two copies of K&R, or "The C Programming Language." One I bought my sophomore year of college, and the other was given to me by a good friend who tutored me on UNIX programming for a couple years.

Thanks, Dennis.  And goodbye.
