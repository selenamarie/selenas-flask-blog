From Larry Wall, creator of Perl, in 1995:

[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.misc/msg/4ea8ddd4dfcf8a9b](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.misc/msg/4ea8ddd4dfcf8a9b)

* Learn it once, use it many times

    You learn a natural language once and use it many times. The lesson
    for a language designer is that a language should be optimized for
    expressive power rather than for ease of learning.  It's easy to
    learn to drive a golf cart, but it's hard to express yourself in
    one.
