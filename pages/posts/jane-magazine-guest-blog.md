Jane magazine's guest blog consists of reader-submitted photos and descriptions of their breasts. The results are both unerotic and fascinating. Because of the portrayal of women and men as near-perfect sexual objects in the media, movies, and porn, it's easy to forget the extent of diversity of people's bodies. â€œI used to think they were horrible compared to all we see in fashion mags...but now I LOVE my body and my BOOBS!!!â€ NSFW, I guess.
