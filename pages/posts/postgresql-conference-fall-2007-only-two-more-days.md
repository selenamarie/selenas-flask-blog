We're taking care of all the last minute details - making sure we have enough coffee Saturday morning, getting nametags printed, stuffing folders and practicing (or in some cases finishing) talks.  

I created a [special page](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/postgresql-conference-fall-2007/) for my conference posts. I've included links to public transportation, all the maps to find your way to and from the conference location and the party, cab info, and links to all my other posts which have more detailed information. 

There is free public wireless access inside the PSU engineering building.  I'll have information on how to connect when you arrive. Please send any questions you have to the [attendees mailing list](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/mailman/listinfo/attendees) (here are the [archives](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/pipermail/attendees/)). 

We are making video and audio recordings of the conference. I'll announce here when they're available and make them all available from the conference page.
