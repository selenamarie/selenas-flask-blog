I didn't want to post this publically, but now that i've discovered the "password-protect" feature.. 

I spent several days stewing over going out to Sherwood tomorrow.  I think that I just didn't want to feel pushed around after what I like to call the Thanksgiving Smackdown.  I'm still feeling a little hurt from what S. said about my ability to deliver a meal on time.

S.'s mom said that we could start by providing easter dinner.  Which would be fine.  I guess.
