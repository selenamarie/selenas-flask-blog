I made it out for the last hour or so of the [December Coder's Bash](http://pdxgroups.pbwiki.org/2007%20December%20Coders%20Social) last night. The first thing I noticed was how many people were there!  At least 50 were still hanging out at 9:15pm on a Tuesday night. 

They were chatting and playing games -- Settlers of Catan, some kind of card game, something involving bean bags. And, of course, there was programming shop-talk. I got to talk about embedded systems with Matt, tried to beg some help with a Drupal installation from part of the PostgreSQL crew, and started to decompress a little from the ERP migration I just completed on Monday. 

And there were a ton of women! My unofficial assessment was that about 15% of the group were women. 

Portland is so awesome. 

I want to thank [Sam Keen](http://twitter.com/samkeen/) for putting this together. I know that a lot of other people were involved, but he was the guy sending out the email, contacting us user group leaders and getting sponsorships. Sam, you really did a great job.
