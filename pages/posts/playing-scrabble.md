I'm trying to get better at scrabble by playing online.  

I've got my two-letter wordlist, and my wordfinder program at hand.  Each game takes about half an hour - so four games later, i'm sitting here with the sun going down.  

This post will be full of random things because I can't seem to tell a consistent narrative today.  

The project for a party did not work out as planned, so now I am just going to use what I cut out by hand.  No letterpress.  It was just a little disappointment, but probably it saved me a bunch of stress in trying to work out a trade.

I also partially cleaned up the leftover pear mess.  Stupid fruit flies!  I have some sourdough that is progressing nicely.  I put in a call to a woman who might have chickens for us.  I am very excited to get new chickens.  Scott even accepted getting three.
