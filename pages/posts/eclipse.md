We had a lunar eclipse this evening. In the last few minutes before the eclipse, I got my camera out, and even managed a lens change (a 135mm my father gave to me a few years ago).  I'm just learning how to shoot at night, but it was fun to play around with the lenses and my digital camera. 

The tempo of the slide changes goes pretty well with Saeglopur by Sigur RÃ³s. [Here's](http://pb.vlogcentral.com/movies/73504.mov) the original.  Still trying to figure out exactly how this embedding thingy works. You'll note that the movie below crops things oddly.
