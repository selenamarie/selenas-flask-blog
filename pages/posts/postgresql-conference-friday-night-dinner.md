<font size='-2'>How to have fun, PostgreSQL-style</font></center>

Those of you in town on Friday evening are welcome to join us at Paddy's at 6pm for dinner:

[Paddy's Bar & Grill](http://paddys.com/contact.php?soundState=on&page=contact)
65 SW Yamhill St
Portland, OR 97204

The reservation is under 'Selena', and we'll be sitting in the front.  The MAX runs directly in front of the restaurant.

Food is good - vegetarian-friendly, but not necessarily vegan or gluten-free. Those looking for those types of food options, let me know - there are actually excellent places nearby to eat, and you could join us a little later for socializing after a proper meal.

I'll be directing those that want dinner at the Code Sprint over there - so I asked for 20 seats.  Please comment or email me if you plan to attend, so that I can ask for more space if we fill up.

This isn't a sponsored dinner - so we'll all go dutch, unless a generous member of a company would like to sponsor us :)

I imagine several members of PDXPUG will be there.  Can't wait to see you all!
