[Michael Schwern](http://use.perl.org/~schwern/journal/34668) just gave a keynote at the [Pittsburgh Perl Workshop](http://pghpw.org/ppw2007/) on the results of the Perl Survey. I did a quick and dirty transfer of the MySQL database to PostgreSQL and Schwern, Gabrielle and I made some views of the data. Schwern put a link to all the database dumps on his blog.

I'm proposing an [Ignite](http://www.igniteportland.com/ ) talk on the survey. Any statisticians reading this blog? I could use your help!
