Check out the slides from my [ptop](http://ptop.projects.postgresql.org) talk.  I was very happy with the end result of the presentation. I had a few people talk to me about the project afterward, including the author of [innotop](http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2006/07/02/innotop-mysql-innodb-monitor/), a perl-based monitoring tool for MySQL.  I'm sure we can steal some ideas from that project!

I haven't gotten much done with ptop since I've been back.  I'll have some time after [LUG Radio Live](http://www.lugradio.org/live/USA2008/)!
