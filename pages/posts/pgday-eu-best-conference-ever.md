Anyone who went will likely tell you how much they enjoyed [PGDay EU 2008](http://www.pgday.org/en/).  My biggest regret this year is that I was unable to attend.

Magnus Hagander's Planet blog is still missing, so I'm blogging the link to [his fabulous photos ](http://mha.smugmug.com/gallery/6322020_Z3SKu)for him. If you see any pictures with missing names or labels, please let him know at magnus -at- hagander (dot) net. 

This conference was once again led by Gabriele Bartolini, and a large supporting team - including the other board members of PgEU - Magnus Hagander, Jean-Paul Argudo and Andreas Scherbaum.  [PgEU](http://postgresql.eu) (for those that don't know) is a non-profit dedicated to promoting PostgreSQL in European nations.  Next year, this conference will be held somewhere in France!  Stay tuned to [planet.postgresql.org](http://planet.postgresql.org) for details!
