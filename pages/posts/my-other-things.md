[Audrey](http://dyepot-teapot.com/2008/04/06/my-other-things/) listed out her projects the other day, and I decided to follow suit: 

*   [PDXPUG](http://pugs.postgresql.org/pdx) - Portland PostgreSQL Users Group.  I just spent the weekend with @markwkm and @gorthx at LinuxFest NW, a fantastic Linux conference. We met tons of people, made some new friends, and got a list of 15 people who want to be part of a new PostgreSQL User Group in Seattle!  Also, there was a Tesla Coil. PDXPUG will host PGDay on July 20th, just before OSCON.  It will be a day of talks, followed by a great party!
*   [User Group Liaison, PostgreSQL Global Development Group](http://postgresql.org) - I'm running [pugs.postgresql.org](http://pugs.postgresql.org). Our community is adding about 2 new user groups a month throughout the world.  I've given 6 talks in the last month, and will be giving two talks about people and user groups at OSCON.
*   [PgUS](http://www.postgresql.us) - The United States PostgreSQL Association.  I am Director, Treasurer and chief Guerrilla Marketing Campaigner (self-assigned title).
*   [Legion of Tech ](http://www.legionoftech.org)- Board member, and part of the Finance committee.
*   [BarCamp Portland](http://barcamp.org/BarCampPortland) - Fundraising coordinator, and trying to set up a long-term repository for conference notes, audio and video. We've got hosting of a super fast server from the Open Source Lab.  Now I just need to finish configuring the website!
*   Gardening. I really like gardening.  I had great compost this spring from compostable food, chicken manure, lawn debris and dirt/grass we'd dug up from our front yard. We removed the last of the grass from the front yard, and I'm hoping to get some tomatoes up there soon.
*   Chickens. I keep two chickens in my backyard and they are each laying 1 egg/day.
*   [ptop](http://ptop.projects.pgfoundry.org). I help hack on ptop, a postgresql monitoring tool written in C.
*   [PerlMongers](http://pdx.pm.org). I regularly attend the Portland Perl Mongers and recently gave a talk on PL/lolcode - a lolcode implementation for the stored procedure engine inside of PostgreSQL.
*   [Code-n-splode](http://pdx.codensplode.org). I helped found code-n-splode, a coding group dedicated to getting more women involved in programming.

What about you?
