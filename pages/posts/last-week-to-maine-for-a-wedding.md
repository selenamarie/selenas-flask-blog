I was in Maine last week for the first time, attending the wedding of Scott's youngest uncle Dwight, and last member of his generation of Deckelmanns to get married, and Kevan.

I took a few photos, made a couple of the family cakes (Viennese Speckled Sponge Cake), helped out with all sorts of last minute preparations and had a great time with everyone.

Twenty of us travelled to Maine for the wedding, and we all stayed in a farmhouse sitting near a pond, and overlooking an inlet leading to the ocean. Walls were paper thin, and most of us slept dormitory style, and we shared a single shower between us all. It was beautiful, and the weather was perfect for the wedding - 72F and a slight breeze.

Now I'm in NYC for a few days before heading down to Atlanta for Grace Hopper.
