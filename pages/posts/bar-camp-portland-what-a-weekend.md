I'm still buzzing from [BarCampPortland](http://www.barcampportland.org). I loved every minute of it, and managed to learn a ton from all the amazing people in Portland. I met a ton of new people, and started several more projects :)

Over the course of two days, I ran two sessions. The first was about [PostgreSQL](http://barcampportland.chesnok.com/drupal/node/30):

We had a fantastic discussion, totally filled the room up with people curious about what PostgreSQL can do.  We had several requests for MySQL -> PostgreSQL "rosetta stone" documentation. 

The second session was [How to raise or eat chickens sustainably](http://barcampportland.chesnok.com/drupal/node/127):

We had an incredible conversation - ranging from getting and raising chickens for the first time, to digging up your lawn and planting food, to gentrification, to obsessive local eating. 

I also attended these others: [DSLR](http://barcampportland.chesnok.com/drupal/node/53), [Bikes and Geeks Collide](http://barcampportland.chesnok.com/drupal/node/92),[ Project Management](http://barcampportland.chesnok.com/drupal/node/112), [My Other Thing](http://barcampportland.chesnok.com/drupal/node/7), [Women in Tech](http://barcampportland.chesnok.com/drupal/node/73), and a session at WordCamp.

I think it's finally time to go to sleep. Check out a ton of [pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/selenamarie/sets/72157604858432529/). Thanks so much everyone who attended, led sessions and volunteered this weekend!
