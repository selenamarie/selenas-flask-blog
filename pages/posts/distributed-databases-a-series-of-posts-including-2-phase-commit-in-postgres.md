There's a fantastic set of blog posts about distributed databases and network partitioning, starting with this post explaining the perils of trying to "[communicate with someone who doesn't know you're alive](http://aphyr.com/posts/281-call-me-maybe)."

The next post is about [Postgres and 2-phase commit](http://aphyr.com/posts/282-call-me-maybe-postgres).  And there are four [additional](http://aphyr.com/posts/283-call-me-maybe-redis) [posts](http://aphyr.com/posts/284-call-me-maybe-mongodb) in [the](http://aphyr.com/posts/285-call-me-maybe-riak) [series](http://aphyr.com/posts/286-call-me-maybe-final-thoughts).

The whole series worth reading for anyone interested in data stores, consistency and Postgres! :)
