Thanks everyone who gave talks and attended meetings! User groups are only as good as the people who participate in them, and this list shows just how talented, diverse and fun the Postgres community is in Portland.  I love you guys!  

Looking forward - once again, we've already scheduled talks through the next four months!  I feel like the group is running on its own momentum, and that is a fabulous feeling. We have a data visualization talk, another Extreme Database Makeover, and hopefully a presentation about teaching database theory with PostgreSQL.

Our next meeting is on January 15, 7pm with Stephen Jazdzewski traveling all the way from Eugene to present SplendidCRM, a formerly Microsoft SQL-only system that is now [compatible with PostgreSQL](http://www.splendidcrm.com/Documents/CaseStudyCBTNuggets/tabid/115/Default.aspx).  I am happy to see more of our Microsoft colleagues joining and presenting to the user group communities, as I've always felt they are underrepresented in our groups. Also, I'm happy to host another out-of-town presenter here in Portland!  Hope to see you on the 15th.
