Just before heading off to PgCon, I wrote about [offline community](http://www.osbr.ca/ojs/index.php/osbr/article/view/888/858) and how it has positively impacted the tech community in Portland, OR. Specifically, I talked about the factors I thought encouraged women to participate. 

My own experience with Postgres has been incredibly positive and welcoming. I always wish that I had more time to contribute. 

I did find a little time this weekend to upgrade the [PostgreSQL User Group](http://pugs.postgresql.org) site to the latest supported version of Drupal. We're still on version 5.x, and hopefully I'll be able to upgrade that to version 6.x soon. We've had a few problems with spammers, but I added a CAPTCHA that I hope isn't too annoying for everyone.

If you have ideas for how to display the information on the PUGs site in a better way, please get in touch. I have a couple things I'd like to add soon - like a map of locations, and a better preview of recently posted articles.
