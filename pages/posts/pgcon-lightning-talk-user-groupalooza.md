I gave a Lightning talk today about PostgreSQL User Groups.  I wasn't able to get through ALL my slides - but I only had to rush through the last three.  (click on the cat below to download - 5MB)

Lightning talks are some of my favorite sessions.  I got to announce the[ incorporation of PostgreSQL-EU](http://people.planetpostgresql.org/mha/index.php?/archives/172-Welcome-PostgreSQL-Europe.html)!  We had a talk about DBIx::Cache (which you should all check out!), a cool open source lab in Japan that Hiroshi Saito works for (only for Japanese, but very cool), Gavin Roy talked about Staplr and a new benchmarking tool called [Playr](https://area51.myyearbook.com/trac.cgi/wiki/Playr) that was just released on Thursday, and six more talks!  We hope to publish the rest of the slides shortly.
