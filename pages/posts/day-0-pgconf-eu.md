Yesterday was spent settling into the Casa 400 and reconnecting with the European Postgres community!

The hotel allowed us to check in very early and so I got to settle in, grab lunch and a nap before we set out for the evening. 

We had informally decided to go on a pub crawl with whoever was already in town. The decision making about where to go started around 5pm.

We now have [about five years](http://www.flickr.com/photos/u-suke/101236328/) of [experience trying](http://www.flickr.com/photos/selenamarie/3259324875/in/photostream/) to [get 20 or more](http://andreas.scherbaum.la/pictures/v/events/fosdem_2008/dsc_3475_640x480.jpg.html) people [into bars and restaurants](http://www.flickr.com/photos/selenamarie/3260724507/in/photostream/) without calling ahead and last night, luck was with us!

I broke down our lessons learned as follows: 

*   Start the planning one hour before the intended departure time.
*   Have a printed map, even if it is not consulted.
*   Ask for help from locals.

Thanks to Greg, we actually asked a local bar owner about where to go, and he called a friend's restaurant for us! 

We ended up at Nels for dinner with nearly 25 people taking over most of the restaurant. I was lucky enough to have a friend in town from Portland that joined us for a long conversation about marketing, PostgreSQL, geek cruises and aircraft carriers. I think I have a topic now for a [lightning talk](http://www.postgresql.eu/events/schedule/pgconfeu2011/session/217-lightning-talks/).

After that, we walked around searching for ice cream for [Ads](http://andreas.scherbaum.la/blog/). We ended up at Pasta e Basta, which had ice cream and singing wait staff. After hearing "Hit the road, Jack", "Here comes the sun" and a few other tunes, we closed out the night at the hotel bar. 

I got to meet the author of [pgChess](https://github.com/gciolli/pgChess), Gianni Ciolli, and catch up with Jonathan Katz, Dimitri Fontaine and Peter Geoghegan. 

All in all, a great start to the week at the conference!  I'll be room hosting this afternoon in room #3.
