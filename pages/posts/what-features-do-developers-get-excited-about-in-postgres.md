I'm here at [DjangoCon](http://djangocon.us/) in Washington, DC and thinking about what it is that developers are currently excited about in [Postgres](http://postgresql.org). 

Postgres hackers are often very focused on solving our own problems, problems people bring up on our mailing lists and dealing with database scaling, replication and data management. 

Developers using Postgres seem more interested in the features which make creating applications easier and removing complexity from architecture. 

So, what are they interested in? 

The features that I hear mentioned most often include: 

*   `[hstore](https://postgres.heroku.com/blog/past/2012/3/14/introducing_keyvalue_data_storage_in_heroku_postgres/)`
*   [Foreign Data Wrappers](http://www.depesz.com/2011/03/14/waiting-for-9-1-foreign-data-wrapper/), [available FDWs](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers), [multicorn](http://blog.database.com/blog/2011/11/21/a-database-comforce-com-foreign-data-wrapper-for-postgresql/)
*   `[LISTEN/NOTIFY](http://blog.endpoint.com/2010/09/listennotify-improvements-in-postgresql.html)`, [using with Node.js](http://bjorngylling.com/2011-04-13/postgres-listen-notify-with-node-js.html)

(thanks to @[ipmb](http://twitter.com/ipmb) for the list in a lightning talk today!)

What are the features you hear about from developers? Or if you're a web developer, what are your favorite features in PostgreSQL?
