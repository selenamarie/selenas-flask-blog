Last night, the Scappoose School District sent out a press release announcing that [Scappoose High School](http://www.scappoose.k12.or.us/highschool/index.html) be accepting the students from Vernonia. From the press release: 

> Just moments after students completed their final exams on Thursday, December 6th, Sue Hays, the Scappoose High School principal, asked the entire student body and staff if they were up for one more challenge. The response was a resounding â€œYes!â€  Unofficially dubbed â€œThe Vernonia Projectâ€ around the SHS halls, this grassroots effort between the Vernonia Schools and SHS was the idea of students and staff concerned with how to help their friends and neighbors.  In less than 24 hours, the effort has been approved and is underway to host the 6th through 12th graders from Vernonia left without books, supplies and classrooms as a result of the recent flood damage.

Vernonia students will start coming to the Scappoose High School on December 11th. Staff expected the relocation would last 4-5 weeks, but an exact end-date has not been specified. 

Scappoose High,  in conjunction with Scappoose Fire Station Share & Care Program, is also holding a fundraiser for the Scappoose & Vernonia Food Bank, collecting cash and non-perishable food donations to help restock the Bank's pantry. All proceeds from the next [three home basketball games](http://highschoolsports.net/defaultcal.cfm?ct=w&schoolid=OR9705618158&spt=-1&lvl=-1&division=-1) will be donated to the Food Bank.
