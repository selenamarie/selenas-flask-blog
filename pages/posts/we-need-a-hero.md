I spoke with a woman from a university that said she thought what we needed was a hero. Somebody that would inspire people outside our industry and rally the people inside it already. And they should still be living :)

I named a few possibilities - kc klaffy, Allison Randal, Evi Nemeth. If you've got others, leave them in the comments. Not sure I agree with the her, but I thought it was worth mentioning.
