Just listened to this interesting interview about Open Source project management, virtualization, Ubuntu. A couple quotes: 

> If you want your open source project to succeed...you absolutely have to have modularity.> 
> --Matt Asay

He was talking about modularity that encourages developer participation - and they went on to talking about Open Office and the problems with their dev structure that drive developers away. 

> What i'm personally very interested in is how we collaborate efficiently... How do we improve the flow of collaboration? So that's something we spend a lot of time working on within Ubuntu. > 
> -- Mark Shuttleworth

Lovin' it.
