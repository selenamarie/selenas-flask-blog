I'm finally getting to blog, and here are a few highlights: 

* "[Mistakes were made](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/18777)" was a great time. Thank you everyone who shared stories. And those of you who attended, please connect with me - email or whatever, and let's continue our discussions about failure.
* I have a little bit of editing to do left on the [harder, better, faster, stronger](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/19275) [slides](http://chesnok.com/u/3u). Talk ratings have been very high (thank you audience! :)  Should have that up tomorrow!
* Not having a booth at OSCON was a real bummer for Postgres. We need to figure out a way to make this happen for us every year.
* Great having the time to connect with old friends in the hallways this week. 
* Thanks O'Reilly for supporting our open source community.
* Thanks Google Open Source Programs office for bringing together open source leaders yet again this year for some important conversations.

Thank you everyone from the [Postgres community who contributed to the Postgres day](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/21523) just before OSCON. All the speakers and their talks are[ listed here](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PDXPUGDay2011).

We need to keep having adjunct events like this!  I think [LCA has it right scheduling Mini-BoFs](http://linux.conf.au/) to provide networking opportunities for the distinct groups. I think OSCON should formalize this next year, and figure out a way of facilitating those groups in a more structured way. 

I have another blog post brewing about difficult conversations.. but that's going to have to wait until after I enjoy the brewers fest!
