[![tech gender gap](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/tech_gender_gap.thumbnail.jpg)](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2007/10/01/participation-in-open-source-any-worse-than-the-rest-of-the-industry/tech-gender-gap/ "tech gender gap")

One criticism I've heard about [my article](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/womenintech/2007/09/28/to-sir-with-love-how-to-get-more-women-involved-in-open-source.html) is that I should have addressed the computing industry as a whole, rather than targeting Open Source. That the problem of women participating is much more general.

I chose to write about Open Source because that's my community. I installed Slackware in 1995 and learned about operating systems from a Linux command prompt, years before I took a class about it. When I worked at Intel, and there were a lot more women in my systems administration group (about 20%) than I saw on the Linux Kernel mailing list, the Cricket developers list or BugTraq. That's part of where I formed my opinion. 

Here's a [little graph](http://apnews1.iwon.com/image/20070920/COMPUTER_SCIENCE_WOMEN.sff_GFX119_20070920164947.html?date=20070923&docid=D8RR94080) showing the number of bachelor's degrees granted in computer science.    We've had a 15% drop in degrees granted since 1985\. I wonder what we were doing right in the early '80s.

There are other resources: FLOSSPOLS, salary studies that show gender breakdowns. I've also read figures on conference attendance and observed the difference in open source and system administration conferences. I do admit that I have not seen studies that directly compare open source participation to closed source participation. 

How about you? Anyone out there have a study they can refer me to?
