I asked twitter last night and this morning "[What blogs / aggregators do you follow for business advice? Looking for lifehacker for business and management](https://twitter.com/#!/selenamarie/status/189880474099916800)".

Here were the answers: 
<!--more-->

*   [Ben Horowitz](http://bhorowitz.com/) x2 and new to me
*   [Critical Path](http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-critical-path/id442816705) by @[asymco](http://twitter.com/asymco) (I was already a listener. I was looking more for blogging or long-form writing, but I agree this is a great podcast.)
*   [One FTE](http://onefte.com) This is a comic, but I agree it has some great business insights. ;)*   [Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/)
*   [Panda Whale](http://pandawhale.com/) I've already found [Joyce's](http://twitter.com/troutgirl) thread about adjustable desks useful, and shared it with friends.
*   [Rands in Repose](http://www.randsinrepose.com/)
*   [Unicorn Free](http://unicornfree.com/) @[amyhoy's](http://twitter.com/amyhoy) business blog. Infrequently updated, though.

And at least [Joyce](http://twitter.com/troutgirl) mentioned that people aren't going to have a whole lot of bloggers they mention, because really - you want advice from fellow entrepreneurs, not bloggers. 

For the last few weeks, I've been reading [HBR.org](http://blogs.hbr.org/), [INC.com](http://www.inc.com/)'s blogs and [Fortune CNN's blog](http://management.fortune.cnn.com/) for topic/writing inspiration. 

I get Hacker News weekly digests, and Startup Digest in email. I find that both mostly echo what I've already read from friends, which I probably don't need reiterated in email.

And I read [Planet Postgres](http://planet.postgresql.org), [High Scalability](http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/3/9/stuff-the-internet-says-on-scalability-for-march-9-2012.html), [Women 2.0](http://www.women2.org/5-lessons-from-zuck/), [Google Research Blog](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2012/01/data-and-code-open-sourced-from-googles.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FgJZg+%28Official+Google+Research+Blog%29) and [Daily Bunny](http://dailybunny.org/post/20408076443/bunny-is-a-scholarly-bunny). I really like [@katemats](http://twitter.com/katemats)' shared links. 

And I get a lot of curated content from friends on Twitter, of course. I'm trying to figure out how to use [Stellar](http://stellar.io/selenamarie/flow), but haven't quite grokked it yet.

Other things: [Geek Feminism Blog](http://geekfeminism.org/2012/04/01/the-gap-and-the-wall/), [Sumana's Blog](http://www.harihareswara.net/sumana/2012/02/05/0), [Apophenia](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2012/01/23/how-parents-normalized-teen-password-sharing.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+zephoria%2Fthoughts+%28apophenia%29), [Napsterization](http://napsterization.org/stories/archives/000769.html),  [Bike Portland.org](http://bikeportland.org/2012/02/10/riding-along-with-paul-jeffery-on-his-daily-ride-up-mt-tabor-67010?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+BikePortland+%28BikePortland.org%29) and [Penelope Trunk](http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/) (even though I largely disagree with her these days).

For visual stuff, I scan [nerdboyfriend](http://nerdboyfriend.tumblr.com/), [Hel Looks](http://hel-looks.com/20120404_02/), and [Sartorialist](http://www.thesartorialist.com/). I like Pinterest, but I find that I *create* boards from image searches there, more than I browse others. 

The last few aren't directly business-related, but they do influence my thinking and help me shape writing, thought and art. Looking at the list I just made, I notice that I've shifted my reading to women's writing. Last year when I looked at what I'd been reading, there were almost no women's voices. 

What do you read?
