[Robert](http://www.xzilla.net/blog/2009/Jan/select-from-things-limit-7.html) tagged me, and I've been procrastinating on a 'stuff I did in 2008' post, and this seems more fun anyway. Here goes:

1.  I've never seen the Grateful Dead in concert, despite graduating from the University of Oregon. Yes, I attended before Jerry died.
2.  I started college as a Chemistry major, intending to switch my major to musical performance.
3.  I competed in a Junior Miss pageant in high school. I wore spandex and danced a synchronized routine to 'Tusk', by Fleetwood Mac. I played a violin solo. I lost.
4.  The last time I played the violin publicly was about five years ago for my friend Amy's orchestra, essentially a chamber orchestra that was a several-month experiment in improvisation with many musicians from the Portland area. The project was a collection of songs she wrote about eight artists and performers that inspired her.  The performance was also a release party for the book [DIY in PDX](http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?isbn=9781141131976&atch=h&utm_content=You%20Might%20Also%20Like#product_details).
5.  I once unwillingly spent the night in a Venice convent.
6.  I made another '[I am not a douchebag](http://www.flickr.com/photos/selenamarie/3140885813/)' bag for the family Christmas party gift. I've made three, one of which I was actually paid ("commissioned" hah!) to make.
7.  In 2008, I managed to increase my houseplant count from 0 to 4\. All are still living as of this blog post.  My chicken count went from 3 to 1.

2.  [Mark Wong](http://pugs.postgresql.org/blog/92) - since he started the P5 series last week!
3.  [Emilie Steele](http://pugs.postgresql.org/node/459), because we didn't get a chance to talk nearly enough last year at PgCon
4.  [Magnus Hagander](http://blog.hagander.net), because he should blog more and he hasn't responded to Robert's tag yet
5.  [Andy Lester](http://theworkinggeek.com/), because his book rocks, and lots of people are going to need it this year

the rules: 

1.  Link your original tagger(s), and list these rules on your blog.
2.  Share seven facts about yourself in the post - some random, some weird.
3.  Tag seven people at the end of your post by leaving their names and the links to their blogs.
