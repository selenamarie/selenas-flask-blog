Here's what I wrote after listening to an NPR story about [sleep deprivation and teens](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6894556).  Here's what I wrote to NPR:
> I waited to hear something about diet and exercise in Allison Aubrey's story about teens and sleep.  The message seemed to be that 2/3 of teens suffer from sleep problems, and to solve the problem parents need sleep specialists to tell them what to do.  I had a hard time with the implication that a melatonin pill is easier and more effective than removing TVs and computers from bedrooms! C'mon! Parents need to help their kids make healthy choices that are sustainable. Part of that is putting limits on entertainment. Another part is showing their kids that exercise and diet are the keys to long term health and a good night's sleep.

We'll see if I'm famous tomorrow.
