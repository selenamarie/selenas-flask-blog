I put together the recipe project today and finally put them into their chrome box.  I wrote 5 or 6 of them out, and then realized that it would be a much nicer present if the authors of the recipes wrote them out themselves.

I brought in all my wedding photos yesterday for duplicates to be made.  It was a nice feeling to finally have them done.  This Friday I should be getting them back.  I also thought that I should talk to Bosco more.  

I read through a ton of blog entries by [rms](http://www.richardstallman.org) and wondered why I was so obsessive.  I spent about 4 hours with chickens yesterday.  It felt good.
