Last week, I accepted the role of [User Group Liaison for PostgreSQL in North America](http://www.postgresql.org/contact). Thanks, [Joshua Drake](http://www.commandprompt.com/blogs/joshua_drake/), for nominating me. And thanks to everyone who commented on the thread. I was smiling for a couple days from the nice things that were said. 

My first task is to upgrade the now elderly [PUGS server](http://pugs.postgresql.org) - the site for our User Group blogs.  Look for an updated site on Monday!

I will be attending [SCALE](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/) on February 8-10\.  I'll definitely be seeing talks from the Women in Open Source track, hanging out at the PostgreSQL Booth, and attending the LA PostgreSQL Users Group BoF session at 8pm, Saturday February 9 in the Laguardia room.  See you there!

**Update:** I made the PostgreSQL [Weekly News](http://people.planetpostgresql.org/dfetter/index.php?/archives/156-Postgres-Weekly-News-January-27-2008.html)!
