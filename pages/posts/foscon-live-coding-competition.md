The Portland Ruby Brigade is cooking up a great [FOSCON](http://pdxfoscon.org/start) this year, hosted at Cubespace. It's all happening on Wednesday, July 23, 2008 from 6pm-9pm. 

I'm going to miss some of FOSCON this year, but I'm hoping to catch some of the [Live Coding Competition](http://pdxfoscon.org/competition). In Drupal's corner, Jakob Perry (of [Ubercart](http://www.ubercart.org) fame) is leading the charge with Joshua Brauer. Ruby on Rails will be represented, as will a couple other web frameworks or content management system.

Rumor has it, Jakob and Joshua are going to rock this competition. If you're a Drupal enthusiast, see if you can make it over to Cubespace to cheer them on Wednesday.
