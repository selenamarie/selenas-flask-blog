Yesterday on IRC, a Postgres user -- goodwill in #postgresql on Freenode -- piped up and said he'd really like to see an Los Angeles, CA Meetup. 

We have a [mailing list](http://archives.postgresql.org/lapug/), but it's gone a bit quiet in recent months. 

So, in a fit of doocracy, goodwill created [LA Postgres](http://www.meetup.com/lapostgres).

He needs a critical mass of folks before announcing the first meeting. So [sign up today](http://www.meetup.com/lapostgres), and help create a vibrant Postgres scene in Los Angeles.
