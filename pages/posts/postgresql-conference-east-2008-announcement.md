Joshua Drake sent out the announcement for the [PostgreSQL Conference East '08](http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-advocacy/2007-11/msg00123.php) just the other day. We're both super excited about getting the community together in Maryland. I'm also really looking forward to meeting the many contributors living in that area for the first time.

I was originally drawn to the [University of Maryland](http://www.umd.edu/) as a site for our conference because of [UMLUG](http://www.umlug.umd.edu/), a Linux student group. They had an [intro to PostgreSQL and MySQL meeting](http://www.umlug.umd.edu/meetings/) in early November, and I've chatted a little with their enthusiastic President. 

I've also been in touch with the Computer Science department. Professor Louiqa Raschid has been invaluable - getting me in touch with the department head, Professor Larry Davis. The UMD CS department is now sponsoring us!  I'm looking forward to collaborating with the students and faculty to make this a fantastic conference.

Joshua has also posted the members list for our [conference and speakers committees](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/contact/). If you have an idea for a talk or tutorial, please don't hesitate to contact us! With the [8.3 beta available](http://www.postgresql.org/developer/beta), and the release just around the corner, there are so many things out there to talk about.  Keep the submissions coming!
