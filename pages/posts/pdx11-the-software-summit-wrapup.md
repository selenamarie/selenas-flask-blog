So, the software summit happened this evening. Mike Rogoway posted his brief overview here: [http://blog.oregonlive.com/siliconforest/2010/12/portland_gathers_software_deve.html](http://blog.oregonlive.com/siliconforest/2010/12/portland_gathers_software_deve.html). The back of my head, Teyo and Amy are featured on the bottom of the photo :)

I livetweeted the event, so tomorrow there'll be a cavalcade of tweets here: [http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2010/12/03/twittering-on-2010-12-03/](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2010/12/03/twittering-on-2010-12-03/)

Big ideas: 

*   Portland is about **Community**. And our competitive advantage is that community.
*   Part of what makes us what we are is the fact that we stick with the same companies over time. What can we do to enable collaboration across company boundaries?
*   We cultivate enduring wealth.

My takeaway from the Q&A was that we've got this huge biz/developer divide. We have management talent - but maybe not the big M&A talent that the VC-oriented folks are after. We have loads of developers. We need to make more effort to get those folks connected to one another in a way that makes sense!

We have tons of events that are advertised on calagator.org, and the city is making an effort to make itself a hub (hosting Lunch 2.0, and now this software summit in the City Council Chambers). Overall, I really think the City is doing a great job, and I can't wait to see what the citizen initiatives come up with.
