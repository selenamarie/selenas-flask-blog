Quickly: [James Terwilliger](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~jterwill/) and [Rafael J. FernÃ¡ndez-Moctezuma](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~rfernand/) gave a fantastic talk about relational algebra operators (there are 9, arguably 8). They started with the set theory origins, dropped [Codd's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd) name a few times and captivated the room.  There was also mention of proof by intimidation, brandishing of duct tape, fabulous drinks mixed by Gabrielle Roth, and twenty-one people in attendance.

Before the talk, we had an impromptu "What is HOT?" (HOT stands for Heap-ONLY Tuple) from Jeff Davis. More details on that later.  I think we need more 15-minute, what-is-this-new-feature-and-why-is-it-awesome talks.
