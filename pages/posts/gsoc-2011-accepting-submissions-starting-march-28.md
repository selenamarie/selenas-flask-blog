The PostgreSQL project has been accepted into the Google Summer of Code 2011.

Students may begin submitting proposals starting March 28, concluding
on April 8.

Development work runs from May 23 through August 15\. For students,
suggested projects, ideas and details are at:
[http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/GSoC_2011](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/GSoC_2011)
Our GSoC landing page is at:

We encourage students to contact project admins - me, Josh Berkus and
Robert Treat this year - if they have questions. Once students have a
proposal in mind, we will encourage them to engage with pgsql-hackers
to flesh out their proposals and get feedback the same way that all
contributors do. For those of you who have been around for previous
GSoCs, this should be familiar to you. :)
