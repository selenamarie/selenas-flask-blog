A friend asked about programs suitable for a 10 year old and a 14 year old girl in the Portland area.

Here's what I came up with:

> As far as things that are already underway: [http://www.chicktech.org/](http://www.chicktech.org/) has the most stuff for the 14-year-old
> 
> Looks like it happened in January: [http://www.chicktech.org/participants/workshops/](http://www.chicktech.org/participants/workshops/)
> 
> Next there's FreeGeek: [http://www.freegeek.org/](http://www.freegeek.org/)
> 
> [http://www.freegeek.org/volunteer/](http://www.freegeek.org/volunteer/)
> 
> Their "adoption" program is interesting because you learn how to put together your own computer. Highly recommended.
> 
> There's online programming courses offered through ORVED: [http://www.orved.org/](http://www.orved.org/)
