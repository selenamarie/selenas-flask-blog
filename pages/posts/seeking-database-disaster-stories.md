I'm going to give another "Mistakes Were Made" talk at [PgConf.EU](http://2011.pgconf.eu/) next month. 

I have many disaster stories of my own, but am always looking for more! Stories of data-destruction and tales of unexpected failure are welcome. 

You can leave them in the comments, or [email me](mailto:selena@chesnok.com).

The talk focuses on the ways in which systems fail, and the typical kinds of failure we find in web operations. Types of failure I focus on are: 

* Failure to Document
* Failure to Test
* Failure to Verify
* Failure to Imagine
* Failure to Implement

Stories that fall outside those categories are especially welcome. 

I look forward to your tales of woe!
