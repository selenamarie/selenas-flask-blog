**UPDATE**: Oops. Wrong URL for youtube originally. :)

Here's a quick video showing you how tags work in ePDX and how the PDX11 community is starting to use ePDX to link together resources specific to the entrepreneurs, startups and founders who have participated in the Financing network.

We're looking into how to display, remix and present individual items from this collected information in the future. 

For now, if you want to see the latest that's been added, check out [the resource list](http://epdx.org/search/pdx11resource) as it grows over the next few days.

The PDX11 Financing group [continues to collect this data](http://lists.pdx11.org/pipermail/pdx11-financing/2011-June/000103.html), and has [put together a form](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dERzYWlmRE1wNTcxTXgyZlhKM212UFE6MQ#gid=0) that shows the type of things the group is interested in.  Take a moment and add your resources to that list!
