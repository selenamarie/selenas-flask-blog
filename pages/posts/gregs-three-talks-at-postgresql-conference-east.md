Greg Sabino Mullane will be presenting three talks at [PostgreSQL Conference East](http://postgresqlconference.org/2009/east/) this weekend in Philadelphia, at Drexel University. The talks are [listed on the site](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/2009/east/talks), and here's what he'll be speaking about: 

> **Bucardo**> 
> _April 5, Sunday, 10am_> 
> [Bucardo](http://bucardo.org/) is a replication system for Postgres that uses triggers to asynchronously copy data from one server to many others (master-slave) or to exchange data between two servers (master-master). We'll look at replication in general and where Bucardo fits in among other solutions, we'll take a look at some of its features and use-cases, and discuss where it is going next. We'll setup a running system along the way to demonstrate how it all works.> 
> 
> **Monitoring Postgres with `check_postgres.pl`** > 
> _April 4, Saturday, 2:30pm_> 
> What should you monitor? And how? We'll look at the sort of things you should care about when watching over your Postgres databases, as well as ways to graph and analyze metadata about about your database, with a focus on the `[check_postgres.pl](http://bucardo.org/check_postgres/)` script.> 
> 
> **The Power of `psql`** > 
> _April 4, Saturday 10:30am_> 
> All about everyone's favorite Postgres utility, `[psql](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html)`, the best command-line database interface, period. We'll cover basic and advanced usage.

I've seen a few of Greg's talks -- [The Magic of MVCC](http://technocation.org/node/653/play), Cloning an elephant and a few others.  He's a great speaker and cool guy.  And he's my boss. But I'm not just saying that because he's my boss! Really!

He doesn't like to brag about himself, so I'm gonna help him out.  He maintains [DBD::Pg](http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-Pg/), check_postgres.pl, Bucardo and has had [MANY patches committed to PostgreSQL](http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb?p=postgresql.git&a=search&h=568556b23185bdacebd90b59679f2004c3d44d64&st=commit&s=Mullane).  He's also a volunteer for the PostgreSQL sysadmins team, and specifically helps maintain the git repo box.  He's a contributor to the MediaWiki project.  He's on the board of the [United States PostgreSQL Association](http://www.postgresql.us).  He's basically awesome.

If you're gonna be there, you should check out his talks. And if you can't make it, here's hoping Josh Drake records the talks and shares them with us all! :)
