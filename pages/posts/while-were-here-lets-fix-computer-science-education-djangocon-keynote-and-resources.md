My keynote today is done, the [resources list is here](http://piratepad.net/djangocon-keynote-selena-reading-list) and the slides are below. I wrote slightly different text to address our experience here in the US, but [a mostly-complete transcript of the talk is here](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2012/08/26/froscon-mistakes-were-made-education-edition-talk-slides-and-notes/).

A ton of people came up to me after the talk and we started talking about all the ways that we might be able to solve problems. I [created a mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/operation-computer-science-teacher-connect) for our first few discussions. If you are a person that doesn't like google groups, contact me, as I of course can set up something that's outside of that infrastructure if we have enough people who'd prefer a different place to have this conversation.

We have a plan to contact teachers in our local communities, and ask them what they need that we as open source software developers could help them with.  And we all agreed that want to build things, but we're pausing for a minute to ask the teachers around us what they need first.

For some background, the key bits of reading you should do to get up to speed are the following: 
<!--more-->

*   [Running on Empty](http://www.acm.org/runningonempty/)
*   [CSTA Curriculum standards](http://csta.acm.org/Curriculum/sub/K12Standards.html)
*   [Exploring Computer Science](http://www.exploringcs.org/curriculum), Curriculum for 10-11th grade students</a>
*   [Stuck in the Shallow End](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057P6AMU?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B0057P6AMU&linkCode=shr&tag=tendthegard-20&ref_=wl_mb_hu_c_6_dp), a book about the current state of computer science education through the lens of Los Angeles area public schools

And, finally, here's the storify from the talk.
