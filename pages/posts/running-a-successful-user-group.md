After the [People For Geeks talk](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2008/07/22/oscon-2008-people-for-geeks-leading-without-being-in-charge/), I presented "Running a Successful User Group" with Gabrielle Roth on Wednesday. You can find our slides and our presentation handout over on [Bacon and Tech](http://www.baconandtech.com/?p=16). The handout is pretty cool, take a minute and print it out!
