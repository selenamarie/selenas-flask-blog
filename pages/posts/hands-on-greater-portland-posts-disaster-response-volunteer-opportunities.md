[Hands On Greater Portland](http://www.handsonportland.org/) has posted [disaster response volunteer opportunities](http://www.handsonportland.org/AboutUs/index.php/Disaster_Response.html) on their site. The partner programs are Victim Volunteer Services (Vernonia and Columbia County) as well as the American Red Cross. 

The Red Cross is looking for folks to show up tomorrow morning (12/7/2007) at 8am.  See the Hands On site for details. Vernonia Victim Volunteer Services is also looking for folks to just show up at their space across the street from Vernonia City Hall. 

Hands On will likely be coordinating a few projects in the weeks to come.  If you have some time this weekend, however, just head out to either of the locations mentioned on the [Hands On website](http://www.handsonportland.org/AboutUs/index.php/Disaster_Response.html).
