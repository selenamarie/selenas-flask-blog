We've got our first Haskell meeting tonight. Just a group of us getting together to learn. I have a few todos this morning - install Hugs, pick a tutorial to talk about and write a couple demo programs.

My plan is to write a bicycle wheel spoke calculator in Haskell. I may end up porting it to something else, but I thought it was a sufficiently complex problem to learn a new language with.
