I'm headed off to Boston (and then NYC!) next week for three days of free software love at [LibrePlanet](http://libreplanet.org/), March 19-21\. 

While there, I'll be giving a speaker's workshop - how to give talks at technical conferences. There's not really a magical formula, just lots of tips and things to practice that will help you not only give great talks, but find [excellent places](http://opensourcebridge.org/call-for-proposals) to give those talks, be prepared for speaking to any size crowd, and have a good time while you do it.

I started giving talks at conferences about five years ago, and have been running my own conferences for three years. I still get the butterflies when I get up in front of people, but I've got a whole kit of strategies I now use to deal with it.

The workshop is [scheduled for 3:30-5:30pm](http://groups.fsf.org/wiki/LibrePlanet2010/Schedule/Friday), and I'm sure we'll all head out for dinner and conversation right after. 

I've also got one free pass to the conference left, so leave a comment if you'll be in the area and can use the pass.

Also, I'll have some incredibly profane free software advocacy stickers on-hand to share. We're free software activists, but we can still have fun, right? :)
