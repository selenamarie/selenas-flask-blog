I was talking with @[schmichael](http://twitter.com/schmichael) today and he brought up that it was insane how many different organizing tools are out there, and there's no handy list of tools for new event organizers to use!

So, here's my list of helpful tools if you're trying to run an ongoing tech event: 

*   **Put your event on a calendar like [Calagator.org](http://calagator.org)**: This may be pretty Portland specific, but if there's an event calendar in your area, be sure to put your event on it!  Calagator is great also because it shows you a list of [venues](http://calagator.org/venues) - possible places for you to hold events. When you need space, its likely best to ask other event organizers. In Portland, we have a special list for event organizers. Get in touch if you are an event organizer, and not already on it!
*   **Create a meeting event on something like [Meetup.org](http://meetup.org)**: So many groups still use this. Several PostgreSQL groups do, and [PDX Lean Startup Circle](http://www.meetup.com/PDX-Lean-Startup-Circle/) swears by it. There's also Upcoming.org, but we don't seem to use that as much*   **[Create a google group!](http://groups.google.com/groups/create?lnk=gcphp)** Mailing lists are still the best way to keep in touch with people. All the research on electronic communication says this. Tweeting is not enough!
*   **Don't put tons of interested people on CC or personally-managed Outlook lists**. This is spam, and the people on the CC list can never unsubscribe! It's not just annoying, it is rude.
*   **[Make a twitter account for your group!](http://twitter.com)** Twitter is a great way for the always-connected crowd to stay on top of what you're up to. Easy to search, and quick to post. Try out [Cotweet](http://cotweet.com) if you have more than one organizer!
*   **Tell other event organizers about your event.** They likely know other individuals and groups that would be interested and can use their best judgement in passing an email or tweet along. Don't spam a bunch of unrelated groups!
*   **Make an event announcement** 2 weeks, 1 week the day-before and day-of your event.
*   **Include the following in your announcement:** event name, date, time, speaker name(s), talk title and location including zip code of your event (so people can use maps to find you easily!)

What else do you think an event organizer should have in their checklist?
