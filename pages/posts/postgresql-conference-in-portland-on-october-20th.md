[Joshua Drake](http://www.commandprompt.com), [Josh Berkus](http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/database/soup) and I are organizing [PostgreSQL Conference Fall 2007](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/) here in Portland, OR on October 20, 2007\.  We've got an incredible group of [speakers](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/) lined up, and a great group of [sponsors](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/sponsor.html).  

The conference is free to students, $60 for everyone else.  We have a separate dinner everyone is welcome to for $10\. 

The whole thing is a bargain for a full day of highly-technical talks and the opportunity to meet  contributors to the core of PostgreSQL, local Portland experts and a cadre of smarty pants database-lovers. 

Plus, we're raising money for PostgreSQL advocacy efforts with all money going to the non-profit organization [Software in the Public Interest](http://www.spi-inc.org).

Today, we were working out the details for the schedule to add a talk from Neil Conway titled "Understanding Query Execution in PostgreSQL", which will discuss the query planner and EXPLAIN. This will be great information for those of us who want to understand a bit more about query execution. 

Speaker bios and talk abstracts should be up soon. This week, I'll be working on getting some women-sized tshirts (woo!), A/V recording equipment and working on getting the word out at PSU that the event will be held there. I'd also like to drop some fliers off at Powells Technical, and maybe a few other user group events coming up. Let me know if you think I've missed a user group, or know of some other place I should drop fliers. 

Plus, we've got our next [PDXPUG](http://pugs.postgresql.org/pdx/) meeting on Thursday, September 20th - [Relational Algebra](http://pugs.postgresql.org/pdx/archives/000096.html) with a couple PSU PhD candidates. Rumor is that there will be mixed drinks.
