By popular demand, we're having a session of lightning talks at [Postgres Open](http://postgresopen.org/2012/home) this year!

What is a lightning talk, you ask?  It's a 5-minute talk on a topic of your choosing.  (For this conference, it should be at least vaguely postgres- or database-related.)  Make it as serious or entertaining as you like.  If you've never given a talk at a conference before, this is a great way to try it out.  The audience is forgiving, and it's only 5 minutes!

Slides are not required, but are helpful.

The session will be 5pm - 6pm on Tuesday, Sept 18\.  [Sign up today](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGlBcWxmeVFZZjFfenFOdXAxWjFqZVE6MQ#gid=0)!

There's a limited number of spaces, so get your talks in now! :)
