I recently updated my [PostgreSQL 9.1 slides](http://chesnok.com/u/4U) for a presentation at the [Windy City Perl Mongers](http://www.meetup.com/Windy-City-Perl-mongers-Meetup/events/31544172/).

We discussed 10 features that the Postgres community decided to emphasize in our press releases. The crowd was primarily people who had never used Postgres before, which was a bit of a different audience for me.

It was great to be able to compare notes with folks who are supporting Oracle and SQL Server, and see a lot of excitement for trying out 9.1.

When I'm traveling around, I'll be looking for more non-Postgres user groups to give talks like this. Let me know if you'd like me to come speak at yours!
