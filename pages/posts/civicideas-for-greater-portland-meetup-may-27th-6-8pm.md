> CivicApps Ideas scheduled for Thursday, May 27th, at the Portland Building Auditorium is a two-hour discussion of ideas and datasets between data providers and citizens. As a precursor to the CiviCode Day Event, scheduled one week later at Open Source Bridge, this meeting is your chance to initiate the discussion surrounding your project ideas and data needs with others.
