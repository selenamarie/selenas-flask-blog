[Theo Schlossnagle](http://lethargy.org/~jesus/) wrote a [great blog post](http://lethargy.org/~jesus/archives/110-PostgreSQL-Community.html) about Joshua Drake's keynote. I wanted to respond to some of his comments here. 

I totally agree with Theo that we need to be disruptive! One criticism I have had in the past of the PostgreSQL community is that it has been too centralized, and not willing to experiment with social networking, wikis and other non-hierarchical tools that will get more *end* *users* actively contributing. 

I think all of that is changing with the creation of the PostgreSQL-EU and [USPgA](http://www.postgresql.us) groups, and the fast uptake in [PostgreSQL User Groups](http://pugs.postgresql.org) in the last few months.

Also, I also respectfully disagree with some comments that were made in other sessions about "us not wanting" the type of users that choose MySQL. *I* want those users to come to my user group meetings.  There's tons we can learn from each other. 

We will make PostgreSQL better if we hear and respond directly to criticism from users of the most popular open source database. I'm not saying that Tom Lane and Bruce Momjian need to do that. PUGs should be doing this, filtering out the good/important stuff and communicating information back to -hackers and -core. That's a great service the user groups can provide to postgresql.org. 

Finally, I am so excited about a Baltimore/Washington PUG!!  I had several people approach me about a group.  I think even [the MySQL guy](http://www.xaprb.com/blog/) will be interested. :)
