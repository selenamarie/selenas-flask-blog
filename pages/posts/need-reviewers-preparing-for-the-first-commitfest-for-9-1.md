Now is the perfect time to get involved in Postgres development!

Starting June 15, we're going to have a "reviewfest", as a prelude to the first [commitfest](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/CommitFest) in July. We've already got [28 patches in the queue](https://commitfest.postgresql.org/action/commitfest_view?id=6), and all need reviewers.

Think you're not qualified to review patches? Think again! 

From the [Reviewing a Patch](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Reviewing_a_Patch) documentation:

> If you can apply a patch and you can use the new feature, you're already qualified to start reviewing it.

We will formally kick off a reviewfest on June 15\. 

We will assign reviewers and get all the patches that are queued up for 9.1 reviewed while the final touches are being applied to the 9.0 release. Have a look at [Review A Patch](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Reviewing_a_Patch) guidelines for information about how to conduct your review. We also have a mailing list to track and recruit reviewers - [pgsql-rrreviewers](http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-rrreviewers/). (The extra R's are for 'round-robin')

Please subscribe to the [list](http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-rrreviewers/), and post if there is [a particular patch](https://commitfest.postgresql.org/action/commitfest_view?id=6) you are interested in reviewing!
