Dr Mark Thomas, from UCL, said: â€œThe ability to drink milk is the most advantageous trait that's evolved in Europeans in the recent past.

â€Although the benefits of milk tolerance are not fully understood, they probably include the advantage of a continuous supply compared with the 'boom and bust' of seasonal crops, its nourishing qualities, and the fact that, unlike stream water, it's uncontaminated with parasites, making it safer.

â€œAll in all, the ability to drink milk gave some early Europeans a big survival advantage.â€
