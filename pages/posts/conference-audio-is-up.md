PostgreSQL Conference Fall 2007 audio is [now available](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/talks/)!  Check it out.

I didn't edit much, other than to eliminate break-time chatter. My apologies to Neil Conway -- I missed about 10 minutes of his talk.  Thank goodness for redundancy!  Once I rip the video, I will update the audio and publish the whole thing.

I'm leaving early Sunday morning for a week. I'm taking a break from the interweb while I'm away. So, I look forward to catching up with everyone when I return.
