</span>Apple has been criticized by some environmental organizations for not being a leader in removing toxic chemicals from its new products, and for not aggressively or properly recycling its old products. Upon investigating Appleâ€™s current practices and progress towards these goals, I was surprised to learn that in many cases Apple is ahead of, or will soon be ahead of, most of its competitors in these areas. Whatever other improvements we need to make, it is certainly clear that we have failed to communicate the things that we are doing well.

It is generally not Appleâ€™s policy to trumpet our plans for the future; we tend to talk about the things we have just accomplished. Unfortunately this policy has left our customers, shareholders, employees and the industry in the dark about Appleâ€™s desires and plans to become greener. Our stakeholders deserve and expect more from us, and theyâ€™re right to do so. They want us to be a leader in this area, just as we are in the other areas of our business. So today weâ€™re changing our policy.

Now Iâ€™d like to tell you what we are doing to remove toxic chemicals from our new products, and to more aggressively recycle our old products.
