I'm presenting a 25-minute talk on "[Thinking about Performance](http://conferences.percona.com/percona-performance-conference-2009/schedule.html)" on Wednesday, around 5:25p at the Percona Performance Conference.  My plan is to talk about performance testing and how to go about useful optimizations.  This will be in the context of the PostgreSQL Performance Pad testing, and the performance-focused talks Mark Wong has been giving at Portland State University. Stop by if you get the chance - and you're in San Jose!  It's free.

Robert Treat will be giving a talk on PostgreSQL at 11:15am that should be good, and we're having a BoF during MySQL Con at 7:30pm. Quite a bit of Postgres-focused content at MySQL Con on Wednesday :)

I'm sad that I'll be missing the [Open Source Bridge Town Hall](http://opensourcebridge.org/2009/04/next-town-hall-meeting-is-april-21-2009/) tomorrow night, but you should go!  :)
