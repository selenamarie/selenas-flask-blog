The hallway track is always my favorite part of the conference. I had to give a full-length and a lightning talk today, so much of my time was spent making sure I was really prepared and then giving the talks!

But between talks, I got to chat with Heroku, 2ndQuadrant and EnterpriseDB folks about what they think is coming next in the world of enterprise development and Postgres.

One topic that I touched on in those conversations and my lightning talk ([Postgres needs an aircraft carrier](http://www.slideshare.net/selenamarie/postgres-needs-an-aircraft-carrier)) was that our plan for world domination needs to get quite a bit more specific and actionable.

For the open source community, the right question is not "are we ready to tackle the enterprise?" -- the right question is: Which market segment and customer group are we going to target for complete market domination?

One area that we definitely already dominate is online poker. We have had a few blog posts about it, but not a whole lot else. Another is GIS through PostGIS.

I [created a survey](https://docs.google.com/a/primeradiant.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dEwySU1JLXR1eEVGTm80OUZDOVB1LWc6MQ#gid=0) to try and capture some scenarios from the developers who work with customers every day solving problems. We need to know more about the people using Postgres and the way that they use the database.

If we can get 30 responses, I'll publish the results. It's a bit long, and requires some thought, so I imagine it will take some time to get them all.

If you have a customer that you think represents a good target market for Postgres, take 10 minutes and [fill out the survey](https://docs.google.com/a/primeradiant.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dEwySU1JLXR1eEVGTm80OUZDOVB1LWc6MQ#gid=0) for us!
