I've had a few ideas for writing:

* managing for technical people
* project managment
* gardening 
* chicken tending

That probably adds up to:
* how to be a serial hobbiest

I don't know.  This is probably something that I actually know about.  Maybe i'll just mix myself a drink and enjoy my day off.
