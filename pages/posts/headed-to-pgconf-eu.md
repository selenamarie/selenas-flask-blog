I'm headed to Amsterdam for [PgConf.EU](http://pgconf.eu) and very excited for my very first European postgres Conference. 

I'm giving two talks - Managing Terabytes, and Mistakes Were Made. Both are cautionary tales about the things that one can do terribly wrong with database management, and system operations management. My goal with these talks is to start a conversation about what we can learn from failure. 

I encourage everyone to share their stories about what fails. Not only are they great "campfire stories" for entertainment, but they help us all learn faster, and they teach us what ultimately works when everything is failing.

In the same vein, [UpdatePDX](http://calagator.org/events/1250461397) is putting on another "tales of failure" set of short talks the following week back in Portland. I'll be leading the charge with a short story of my own, followed by at least two other tales of failure.
