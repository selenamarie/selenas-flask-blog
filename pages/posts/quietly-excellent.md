> Late last year in a New York conference room, Mr. Press quietly listened to a pitch from Japanese advertising agency Dentsu Inc. for a campaign that used Toyota's growing American work force as a way to deflect potential criticism over the company's strength in the U.S. Then he politely sent the Dentsu team back to the drawing board.> 
> 
> "I really appreciate your efforts," he said. But "isn't diversity something you don't tout publicly but something you just carry out quietly inside the company?"

> Toyota does not try to win awards as they believe the effort involved to apply for an award is also waste.Â  Instead of trying to win a Shingo Prize, they openly teach their methods to others.> 
> 
> Quiet excellence gives a sense of being deeply real and fundamentally true.Â  Because it usually is.
