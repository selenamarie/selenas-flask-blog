Just a quick note that I'll be at SCALE February 8-10\.  I'll be attending the Women in Open Source track (with maybe a quick side-trip to [DOHCS: Mobile decision support in Tanzania](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale6x/conference-info/speakers/Brian-Derenzi/)), and then helping with the both Saturday and Sunday.  You can direct message me on Twitter (selenamarie) if you're interested in meeting up!

I'm also looking forward to the PostgreSQL BoF on Saturday night (8pm, Laguardia room), and maybe having some sunny weather!
