Back in February, I blogged about [all the sessions related to PostgreSQL](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2011/02/14/postgresql-at-mysql-users-conference-the-sessions/) at MySQL Users Conference this year. 

My stickers just arrived:

Stop by the PostgreSQL booth during the MySQL Expo, or [come to one of my talks](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011/public/schedule/speaker/6486) if you'd like one. 

I'm giving two - one is about Emma's database systems and the problems with scaling huge schemas. And the other is a community talk about managing competing business and community interests inside of the Postgres community, and lessons that other open source communities can learn from our successes and failures.

We're having a [free Birds of a Feather session](http://www.postgresql.org/about/event.1222) Tuesday, April 12 at 7pm at the Santa Clara Convention Center.  Please stop by!
