I'm excited to announce today that some members of the PostgreSQL community and I are launching the [United States PostgreSQL Association](http://www.postgresql.us).

Here's the text from the press release: 

> The United States PostgreSQL Association is launched! Our draft mission can be found at [http://www.postgresql.us](http://www.postgresql.us). We will support PostgreSQL in the US through user group development, conferences,> 
> education initiatives and fun.> 
> 
> We will be a sister organization to PostgreSQL EU, the [Japanese PostgreSQL User Group](http://postgresql.jp), and other international PostgreSQL groups.> 
> 
> The founding members are Joshua Drake, Selena Deckelmann (me) and Michael Brewer.> 
> 
> Nomination and election of four additional board members will occur at the upcoming PostgreSQL Conference West, October 2008\. General membership is open to anyone who wants to support the use of PostgreSQL in the US. The organization is being registered as a non-profit headquartered in Portland, OR, and we are applying for 501(c)3 status.> 
> 
> We are still working out details, but please watch [http://www.postgresql.us](http://www.postgresql.us) for updates!> 
> 
> Questions, Comments?  We'd love to hear from you.  Please send us a message at board <at> postgresql.us.

Look forward to more information over the next few days and weeks about our plans.  In the meantime, you can have a look at our [mission statement and goals](http://www.postgresql.us/mission/).
