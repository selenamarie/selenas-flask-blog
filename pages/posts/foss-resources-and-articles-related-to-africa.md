I spent a little time over the weekend gathering information about free and open source software in Africa, and found at least one active pan-African FOSS organization (FOSSFA), and several interesting articles about governments in Africa using FOSS to open data, and make government more accountable.  It seems that the [Shuttleworth Foundation](http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/) sponsors projects, although it wasn't clear to me whether that sponsorship was primarily for South African projects. 

If you know of user groups, other active FOSS organizations in sub-Saharan Africa, or want to suggest interesting research or articles - please leave a comment!

I've collected everything as PDFs and uploaded it to [drop.io/fossinafrica](http://drop.io/fossinafrica).  I'm also going to link the original sources below.

*   [Free Software and Open Source Foundation for Africa](http://fossfa.net/index.php), organization that has been very active the last few months (2009).
*   [Free/open source software (FOSS) policy in Africa: A toolkit for policy-makers and practitioners](http://www.cipesa.org/153), PDFs of a report and resources at bottom of the page
*   [South Africa's freedom includes its data](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/mar/08/freeourdata.southafrica), article on South Africa releasing GIS data
*   [Chief Directorate Surveys and  Mapping](http://w3sli.wcape.gov.za/), Mapping resource for South Africa with some map data freely available
*   [African Tech Events](http://whiteafrican.com/african-tech-events/), list of tech events including an upcoming Maker Faire in Accra, Ghana
*   [Presentation on FOSS in Africa](http://fossfa.net/index.php?q=node/67), from LinuxTag 2009 (June 22-26, 2009) presented by FOSSFA
*   [FOSS in Africa](http://www.ejds.org/meeting2003/ictp/papers/Gideon.pdf), academic paper on state of FOSS in Africa around 2003

Here are some articles about Microsoft Windows and Linux competition in Africa: 

*   [Microsoft vs the Open Source Community in Africa](http://whiteafrican.com/2009/05/17/microsoft-vs-the-open-source-community-in-africa/), commentary on Microsoft's involvement in Africa
*   [Microsoft Battles Low-Cost Rival for Africa](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122332198757908625.html), Tip: search directly for this URL in Google and view the cached version to get the full text.
*   [Hi Tech Battle for Africa](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8047514.stm), from the BBC. Talks about a disaster response initiative from Microsoft that sidestepped  Ushahidi.com, an established and African-developed disaster response network.

The most disturbing thing I found was a [Wall Street Journal article from October 2008](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122332198757908625.html). The WSJ investigated reports that Microsoft had used relatives of government officials to try to get Windows onto government purchased laptops, and also chronicled the failure of a windows-based lab made of refurbished machines that was essentially abandoned, with only 1/3 of the promised computers installed and little or no training for the local staff to maintain the machines and software.  Sad and frustrating story.

There's also a recent blog post [about Brazil and open source from the OSI](http://www.opensource.org/node/445). That report is anecdotal, so I'm taking it with a grain of salt. Still, it is disappointing.

If you are interested in sponsoring travel for an African government official to Open Source Bridge next year, please get in touch. I have met several technologists here in Nigeria who are interested in sharing their experiences implementing free and open source software in Africa. I am encouraging them to also attend open source events in West Africa, but as it turns out, travel inside of Africa is still quite difficult.
