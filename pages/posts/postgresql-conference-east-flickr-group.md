I created a [Flickr group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/pgconference08/) for the conference and added a few pictures today.  

The weather in Maryland is just like Portland this week!  Kind of drizzly and overcast.  The sun peeked out for a few minutes at sunset, and I had a nice walk around the University of Maryland at College Park campus today. 

I met several people in the UMIACS department, including my new hero, Mike, who created over 100 individual wireless network accounts for conference attendees.  The rooms look great, and the foyer where we'll be having breakfast is very pretty. UMD's campus is just amazing and huge. If you've got an extra hour to spare, take a walk around!
