David Eaves [wrote about open source contributions](http://eaves.ca/2009/07/28/remixing-angie-byron-to-create-the-next-million-mozillians/) recently, and how community managers fit into the picture. 

He remixed a graph from Angie Byron, and I wasn't completely happy with the results. A fairly long twitter thread ensued, between myself, [Jeffrey McManus](http://twitter.com/jeffreymcmanus), [Emma Jane Hogbin](http://twitter.com/emmajanedotnet) and [Peter Krenesky](http://twitter.com/kreneskyp). In the end, David piped up and asked if I'd comment on his blog.  [So I did](http://eaves.ca/2009/07/28/remixing-angie-byron-to-create-the-next-million-mozillians/?dsq=13663998#comment-13663998). :)

Many times it is an organic process -- your friends invite you, or you run into someone at a conference or bar, or you have to use or work on a piece of software for work. For those who, for whatever reason, are not already on the inside, having a single point of contact (a "community manager", or in the amusing case of the open source developer group I primarily work with - a "liaison") can be an invaluable tool.>

They will go directly to the individuals inside the community they most want to connect with -- because I have managed to open up our community interfaces to the point that they are self-documenting, or easily found with a few clicks on our website.>
