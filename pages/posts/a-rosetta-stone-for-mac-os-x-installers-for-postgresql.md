I'm [no longer using Mac OS X for my primary desktop](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2012/11/13/a-mostly-working-lenovo-x230-running-ubuntu-and-gnome3-two-weeks-later/), but many of my coworkers and friends do. Particularly developers writing applications that use PostgreSQL (aka Postgres) for their data storage.

I've spent a lot time over the last few years troubleshooting people's Postgres installs in the following, very common, situations:

*   A developer installed Postgres on their Mac laptop >1 year ago
*   Now they need to upgrade their Postgres to help me, or support a new application that needs new features
*   They have an old database they'd like to migrate to the new version
*   They have no idea which particular Mac OS X installer they used last time

For this exact situation, I have documented some features of the [Mac OS X Installers for Postgres](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Installers/Mac_OS_X).

And, I felt so good to see this right after I posted the wiki page earlier today:
