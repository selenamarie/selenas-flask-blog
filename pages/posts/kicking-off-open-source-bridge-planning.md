We're kicking off the planning for [Open Source Bridge 2010](http://opensourcebridge.org), old school.  We've got a mailing list that you should subscribe to: 

[http://groups.google.com/group/osbridge
](http://groups.google.com/group/osbridge)

Last year's organizing team was very structured. I like to think that we managed things well, and our [attendees](http://jasonmauer.com/2009/trip-report-open-source-bridge/) were [pleased](http://blog.zenlinux.com/?p=276) with the [results](http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/_featured/article.php/3826751/The-Open-Source-Open-Source-Conference.htm).

But, this time - we're changing how we manage things.

We're letting everyone in on our planning process! So, if you enjoyed Open Source Bridge last year, and want to see it be a success this year, [join our mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/osbridge) now, and see if you can lend us a hand.

Thanks!
