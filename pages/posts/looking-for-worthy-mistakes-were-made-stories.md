I'm giving a couple talks at OSCON this year! One of them is titled "[Mistakes were made](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/18777)", and I need a few good stories. 

I'm focused on web operations, but really, any stories where there was a plan, and it went horribly wrong, would be great. And, I'd love to know whether whatever went wrong ultimately got fixed, hacked around or was just left as-is. 

Thanks!
