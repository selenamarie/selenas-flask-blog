Postgres Open is over!

I wanted to share a few resources, and remind attendees to [fill out our survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dGI3MnBkX3kzeUxDY1N6SWNoVEdSNnc6MQ#gid=0). I really appreciate the detailed comments I've been getting!  Keep them coming. 

I wanted to specially thank our program committee: 

Robert Haas
Josh Berkus
Gavin Roy
Greg Smith

They were the people who put together and edited the website, found sponsors, recruited speakers, voted on talks, gave talks and tutorials and executed the many tasks needed to make the conference a success. We plan to make key members of the Postgres community part of the operation of the conference going forward. We're really just emulating the way that [PgCon](http://pgcon.org) is run. 

I have some more thoughts about what makes a conference "community-operated", and once my budget numbers are settled, I'm going to share with you what running the conference costs in terms of my time, and in terms of dollars to operate. It's important to both understand the costs involved, how much of my time is required and what that means for you as either a sponsor, speaker, attendee or volunteer supporting what we are doing.

**NEXT YEAR: September 17-19, 2012**

I'm pleased to announce that next year's conference for September 17-19, 2012 at the Westin-Michigan Ave. So mark your calendars now!

The conference will continue to be operated as a non-profit, with proceeds going toward operation of the following year's event, and a very small percentage going to Technocation, Inc - our fiscal sponsor and a 501(c)3 organization dedicated to developing educational opportunities and resources for software professionals. 

We had fantastic support from our sponsors this year, and hope to expand that next year. 

In particular: 2ndQuadrant, EnterpriseDB, Heroku and VMWare's support were instrumental in pulling this event together. We really only started planning in May. It feels good to now have a whole year ahead of us!

With greater sponsor support, we can help fund some of the things that attendees asked for like: soda (which costs $8/soda - I feel as though we should get some kind of gold plating for this), conference tshirts, and a closing party. 

Please [get in touch](mailto:selena@postgresopen.org) if you or a company you know is interested in sponsorship for 2012! 

**Slides:**

Speakers are uploading or [linking their slides to the PostgreSQL wiki](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Postgres_Open_Talks_2011 ). If the slides you're looking for aren't there, please ping the speaker or me.

**Streaming Video:**

[Streaming content will be available](http://postgresopen.org/2011/video ) for about 30 days. 

I will be getting all the video on flash drives this week. My plan is to upload it to either vimeo or youtube. I don't really have the resources to provide individual copies of the videos, but if we find a location for raw data upload, I'll pass that along to you all.
