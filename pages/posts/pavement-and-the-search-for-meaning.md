I downloaded a [report about pavement](http://www.commissionersam.com/files/Accept%20report%20to%20council%20on%20Portland%20office%20of%20Transporation%20Street%20Paving%20Implementation%20Plan.doc) and portland yesterday. It described what the city is doing to keep the streets maintained. I was bored by page 2.

That's the problem with researching this new job right now - each small setback (an article that bores me to tears, an opportunity to talk with someone in the field lost) seems like a big setback. I see all the things that I'm doing not to move myself into a new career.

Gross. New career. It just sounds so adultish, and un-fun.
