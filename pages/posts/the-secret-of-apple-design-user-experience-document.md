â€œThere were three evaluations required at the inception of a product idea: a marketing requirement document, an engineering requirement document, and a user- experience document,â€ Norman recalls. Rolston elabo rates: â€œMarketing is what people want; engineering is what we can do; user experience is 'Here's how people like to do things.'â€
I really like that idea of â€œa user-experienceâ€ document. Or at least the idea that the user experience - not the feature or change itself - is a documented requirement in a design.  Maybe this is already implicitly part of the DCR process.

I see the user-experience as being a critical part of implementing any kind of change (not just product-related) - how do people like to do things, how do we do things now (if there is a difference) and what does this change have to do with both of those things?
