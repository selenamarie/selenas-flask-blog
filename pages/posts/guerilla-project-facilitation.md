From a thread that came up today on 'post-mortems':

I've been searching around for a replacement term for a long time:

Retrospectives
After Action Reviews

Neither really roll off the tongue, but they feel a little better than post-mortem.

But really - the questions to ask are the most important:

What did we learn?
What are we going to do better next time?
What are we going to do?
If there's a problem, what changes will solve it?
And what is the commitment to make that change?
