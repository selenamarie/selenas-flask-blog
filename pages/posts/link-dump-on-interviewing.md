Been reading up on interviewing.  Here's my most used resources:

*   [Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html)
*   [On Interviewing Programmers](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000226.html)
*   [The Phone Screen](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePhoneScreen.html)
*   [Testing GUI applications](http://www.itworld.com/AppDev/1243/UIR010323testinggui2/)I've been interviewing people for maybe seven years. I've been through quite a few different interviewing situations - my favorite being the startup ISP that had me reconfigure a live network interface (together, we crashed their core web server), and immediately afterward we had a couple pints at Rogue Brewery. Mostly, I try to use behavioral questions (â€œtell me about a situation when...â€), combined with a few open-ended questions about something the person is interested in.
