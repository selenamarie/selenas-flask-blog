We're [hosting an Edit-a-thon in Portland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/Portland) this Saturday.  Join us!

> Selena and Pete invite you to a Wikipedia Edit-a-thon! Join us and the Portland wiki community as we dive into editing the biggest, most fascinating, and most collaborative encyclopedia in human history. This informal event will help you get your bearings, create an account, and start hacking in this decade-old project.> 
> 
> Never edited a web page? Never fear! We will give you a background/overview of how things work, and suggest some easy first-timer edits. Or, if you’re an old hand, please join us and share your valuable knowledge!> 
> <!--more-->> 
> What to bring:> 
> 
> *   A laptop. (If you don’t have one, try to borrow one! Or just let us know you need one -- we will try to come up with a few loaners.)
> *   Ideas. Is there a new Wikipedia article you’ve been dying to write, or an existing one that needs some love? Poke around on Wikipedia before you come, and make a list!
> *   Interesting reference materials -- books, magazines, library card (for logging into databases).
> *   An appetite for knowledge and snacks -- [_____]* has generously kicked in some geek fuel to power us through.

During the last Edit-a-thon I attended in San Francisco, I edited a few articles about Russian Women Writers. I studied russian and russian literature in college, and was able to update articles about [Irina Ratushinskaya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irina_Ratushinskaya) and [Marina Tsvetaeva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Tsvetaeva).

We could use a sponsor for some snacks. Or you could bring some goodies to share. 

If you think you'll join us, [add your name to the participants list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/Portland/Participants)!

Look forward to seeing you this Saturday.
