**UPDATED**: now with shorter and more accurate instructions ;)

I keep forgetting how to do this, so here it is: 

<pre>
account add jabber [your email address]
account set oauth on
account gtalk on
</pre>

And then you'll be prompted to go through oauth authorization with a link in another chat window.
