Do you remember that great [Tekpub videocast](http://tekpub.com/productions/pg/) last year?

Well, one of the hosts is now [switching jobs to work full time on Ruby and Postgres](http://datachomp.com/archives/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-deadlocks/). I'm so excited for all the new developers who are exploring Postgres, asking great questions and helping grow our web developer user base.
