â€œThat's What We're Here Forâ€
Sunday, 9:50 AM
by Mark Graban
My main point here I think is â€œTech Support should NOT be part of the normal process.â€

I needed to register for an internal company tech support website (for teleconference support) and was trying to log in to the website. I have a card here with the following info:
Owner Name
Owner Number
Conference Code
Leader PIN
To log in to the website, it asks for â€œOwner Nameâ€ and â€œPassword.â€ Since nothing I has says â€œPasswordâ€ I tried the â€œLeader PIN.â€ Didn't work. It says â€œIf you are visiting here for the first time, click on forgot password.â€ The â€œforgot passwordâ€ screen wouldn't recognize me as a valid user, so it was time to call tech support.

Turns out, tech support had to give me a 4-digit â€œWeb PINâ€ to be able to start the registration process. I went to another screen and created a â€œUser Nameâ€ and â€œPassword.â€

I got kicked back to the main screen, the place that says â€œOwner Nameâ€ wants you to enter the â€œUser Nameâ€ or it doesn't work (these are two different things).

I said to the tech support rep, â€œYou know, the website is very confusing. I'm good with computers and I couldn't figure it out because things are labeled wrong on screen and it seems every new user has to make a tech support call, which costs us all money.â€

The tech support rep was sort of irritated and said, â€œWell sir, that's what we're here for.â€

I told her, â€œIt shouldn't be that way, I'm just trying to help, if you don't want to do anything to fix the website, then fine.â€

I can't imagine the tech support rep passing any of this along because, in a way, the poorly designed and poorly implemented website is job security for her and her co-workers. Fewer tech support calls probably means somebody loses their job.

It's too bad that organization can't have everyone on the same team in a way that improves quality (and reduces cost) for the company and the customers. How many people tolerate a bad process out of self-interest and/or fear? Management's job is to create an organization where people aren't paralyzed by fear, where they aren't punished for doing the right thing.
