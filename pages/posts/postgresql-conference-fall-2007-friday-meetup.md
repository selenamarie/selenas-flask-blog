A few people on the mailing lists and IRC are organizing a meetup on the Friday before the PostgreSQL conference. Check out the [wiki page](http://tinyurl.com/2b87mv) set up to select a location and say whether or not you'll be there!  If you're a local, vote for the location you'd like to meet at.

Here are the restaurants and bars currently on the list:

> *   NW Lucky Lab - 1945 NW Quimby (pretty central, good space, outdoor seating)
> *   Side Door - 425 SE Washington St (great food)
> *   Paddy's - 65 SW Yamhill Street (right off the max! excellent scotch selection)
