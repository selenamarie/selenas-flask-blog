I spent the weekend at [AdaCamp Portland][6]! This was my fourth AdaCamp and as usual, I came away full of ideas, with new friends and invigorated from all the wonderful conversations. Here are links to posts about [AdaCamp Melbourne][1] and [AdaCamp SF][2] -- [day 1][3] and [day 2][4].

I brain dumped a list of the things that I want to write about:

*   amazing "tech learning experience ingredients" diagram from @mollyclare
*   technical contributor "track" career advancement session
*   Teaching intro SQL (gonna offer a class based on Q&A)
*   my current take on open source database options
*   repeat problems in feminist spaces over decades
*   handling tension between doing what we're asked vs what we want to be doing
*   all the zines i need to make about being pregnant
*   maternity leave hacks
*   fertility hacks
*   the aesthetics of feminist organizations
*   how PyLadies fills up it's workshops with women outside of the existing tech community

Watch this space for a bunch of writing very soon!!

Thanks to [Mozilla][7], I hosted 10 attendees for dinner Saturday evening. We had wonderful conversations about workplace politics, the leaky pipeline problem, career advancement, different kinds of gendered branding for feminist organizations, compromise, great food in Portland, feminist reviews of the science fiction we read as girls, http://uncomfortableworf.tumblr.com/ and memes. Thank you so much to the women who joined!

The next AdaCamp will be in [Berlin in October and Bangalore in November][5]. I'm disappointed that I likely will not be able to attend either. I highly recommend both events!
