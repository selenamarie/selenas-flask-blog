[Audrey](http://dyepot-teapot.com/2008/12/08/the-current-state-of-me/) started a meme that I liked - so here's my answers: 

*   **Did I earn a living?** Yes, I did. I've never been happier with [my work](http://www.endpoint.com/), who I work with and who I work for. I surprised myself a little with a job change that has me working at home, and co-working at various places in Portland. I find myself jumping out of bed every morning, excited to start my work day, and attending amazing geek events 2-3 times a week. (shameful Portland tech scene junkie confession!)
*   **Was I able to incubate new ideas?** Well, I was certainly *exposed* to tons of creative, exciting ideas, and felt energized to participate and organize in ways that I did not in 2007\. As far as generating my own ideas, I think I was in the same boat as Audrey -- spending a ton of time *doing*, but not as much time reflecting on experiences.  The one exception to that was my vacation last August in Mexico.  I took nearly three weeks to unwind from work, and I spent that time learning a little Spanish, and taking photographs that I was very proud of. Looking out to next year, I can't wait to see what happens, and feel like I won't be able to avoid an explosion of creativity.
*   **Did I grow in ways that I wanted?** YES. OMG. I had an incredible year, personally and professionally. I organized two PostgreSQL conferences - one in Maryland! - and helped get new user group leaders started with groups in at least five new locations. I've seen several long-time community members step up, join boards and become more active in the core community building work I championed. I met Tom Lane. I stood by as close friends, inspired by a growing community, started their own projects. I was inspired over and over again by the humor, grace and intelligence of the people who make PostgreSQL happen. I contributed code, presented nearly a dozen talks and traveled.

So, 2009 will be a lot about co-chairing Open Source Bridge, with a big helping of PostgreSQL community work, primarily speaking about the filesystem performance testing we're doing here in Portland, and hopefully a bit more about user groups. I'm looking forward to a great work year, with a company that continues to be successful in a difficult time, and with coworkers that make me laugh every day. 

I'm looking to Portland to inspire me: with cool ideas, exciting companies and a vibrant tech scene. 

Your turn!
