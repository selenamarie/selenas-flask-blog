PostgreSQL is applying for GSoC again this year. We're looking for: 

* Mentors
* Project ideas

Are you a PostgreSQL community member, and would you like to mentor? Please let me know! Our application deadline is Friday, March 11, 2011 so please contact me *before* Friday.

I've started a wiki page: [http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/GSoC_2011](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/GSoC_2011)

It's seeded with last year's todo lists and information. We need to add project ideas for students to it. 

The wiki pages for 2008 and 2010 are available, including links to the original student proposals:
