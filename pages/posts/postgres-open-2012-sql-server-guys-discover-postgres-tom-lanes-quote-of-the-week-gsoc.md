Happy Friday!

[Postgres Open](http://postgresopen.org)'s website is back up! Next week, we'll be announcing sponsorship opportunities for 2012 and opening our Call for Speakers shortly after. 

Some [IT guys discovered Postgres](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl_-lKxSBm4) and made a series of videos about what they're learning. They came from Windows backgrounds, so their observations were a great introduction to what it's like for non-Linux-y people when they first try Postgres out.

Tom Lane reminded us all that [proper maintenance of code involves maintaining comments](http://archives.postgresql.org/message-id/23264.1331232268@sss.pgh.pa.us). 

And, the [PostgreSQL Global Development Group is applying for GSoC 2012](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/GSoC_2012)! Thanks very much to Thom Brown and Josh Berkus for being our admins this year.

Have ideas for projects? Or are you a student interested in applying? Contact [pgsql-students](http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-students/) with your ideas now!
