A few years ago, Surnow received it as a gift from an Army regiment stationed in Iraq; the soldiers had shared a collection of â€œ24â€ DVDs, he told me, until it was destroyed by an enemy bomb. â€œThe military loves our show,â€ he said recently. Surnow is fifty-two, and has the gangly, coiled energy of an athlete; his hair is close-cropped, and he has a â€œsoul patchâ€â€”a smidgen of beard beneath his lower lip. When he was young, he worked as a carpet salesman with his father. The trick to selling anything, he learned, is to carry yourself with confidence and get the customer to like you within the first five minutes. Heâ€™s got it down. â€œPeople in the Administration love the series, too,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s a patriotic show. They should love it.â€
