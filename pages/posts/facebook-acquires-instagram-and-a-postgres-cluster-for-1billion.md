Today's big story is that [Facebook just acquired Instagram for $1 billion](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/04/09/instagram-acquired-by-facebook-service-will-stay-up-and-running-as-is-for-now/). 

Instagram is a hugely popular image sharing app - until recently only for iPhone. Last week they released an Android version, which caused many of my friends to finally start using it. ;)

But you know what's an even bigger story? [Instagram runs Postgres](http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/10853187575/sharding-ids-at-instagram). And, their engineering team has been posting juicy tidbits about [PGFouine](http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/20541814340/keeping-instagram-up-with-over-a-million-new-users-in) and [pgbouncer](http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/13649370142/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances-dozens-of) over the last year. 

I love that companies are succeeding with [Postgres](http://postgresql.org) in a huge way.

We're seeing Postgres become the default technology choice for new tech companies. As those companies grow or are acquired, we'll see Postgres becoming an important part of many more organizations.

It's no coincidence that Bruce posted this morning about "[The New Postgres Era](http://momjian.us/main/blogs/pgblog/2012.html#April_9_2012)". The quality of the Postgres community's software products is recognized, and the developers who use our software are succeeding.
