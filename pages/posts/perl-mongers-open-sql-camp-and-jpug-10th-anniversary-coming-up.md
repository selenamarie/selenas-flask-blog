I've got a busy couple of weeks in November: 

*   November 11, 2009 - I'm presenting [Bucardo](http://bucardo.org/wiki/Bucardo) (a sweet replication system for Postgres) at the [Portland Perl Mongers](http://pdx.pm.org/kwiki/) group, 7pm at [Free Geek](http://freegeek.org).
*   November 13-14, 2009 - I'll be helping run [OpenSQL Camp](http://opensqlcamp.org/Events/Portland2009/) with Eric Day here in Portland, OR. We're having it at Souk, and kicking things off on Friday night at Old Town Pizza, starting around 6pm. Eric asked about having an n-master (multi-multi-multi...etc master) replication session, so I might talk with him about that there.
*   November 19, 2009 - PostgreSQL Clustering Summit in Tokyo. I'll be giving a 5-minute presentation on the state of Bucardo development, and meeting (or seeing again!) the major contributors to replication and clustering technology for Postgres.
*   November 20-21, 2009 - [Japanese PostgreSQL User Group 10th Anniversary Summit](http://www.postgresql.jp/events/pgcon09j/e/pgcon2009j). I'll be presenting a [talk on User Groups](http://www.postgresql.jp/events/pgcon09j/e/program_2#16) with Magnus Hagander, President of PostgreSQL Europe.

I'm happy to say that I've got my slide decks done well in advance this time, and am mostly working on example configurations. I started a repo on github to hold my [bucardo examples](http://github.com/selenamarie/bucardo_examples).  Enjoy!
