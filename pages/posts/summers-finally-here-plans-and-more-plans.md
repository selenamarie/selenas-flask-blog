I've been pretty busy since I left PgCon. [Emma](http://tech.myemma.com) is gearing up for a pretty awesome API release, and I'm working on a bit of tricky migration code.

I've also got a number of upcoming talks to suss out: 

*   Open Source Bridge - [How to ask for money](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/530)
*   Open Source Bridge - [Seven habits of highly effective trolls](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/583)
*   Future of Web Apps - [What databases teach us about performance](http://futureofwebapps.com/las-vegas-2011/schedule/) - in Las Vegas
*   OSCON - [Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger: PostgreSQL 9.1](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/19275)
*   OSCON - [Mistakes were made](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/18777)

And, then August off from the conference circuit, and a trip to Chicago for [Postgres Open](http://postgresopen.org). And I've agreed to MC for another great event coming to Portland this fall.  

So, I've got a busy few weeks ahead preparing for [such great conferences coming here to Portland](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2011/02/15/this-year-is-so-nuts-for-having-conferences-in-portland-or/).

Otherwise, chickens are laying eggs regularly, I've got a delicious looking crop of cherries developing in the front yard, and maybe some strawberries if the sun lasts for a few days. For the moment, I'm taking it easy today, reading a few books and relaxing in warmth that Portland has deserved for quite a few months now.

Cheers!
