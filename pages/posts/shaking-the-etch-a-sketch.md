So. I'm a free agent. 

I've got some consulting work lined up, a few projects to keep me busy ([Postgres Open](http://postgresopen.org "Postgres Open"), a new online class, and some writing). I'm speaking a couple times at [OSCON](http://oscon.com) at the end of the month and MC'ing [Puppet Conf](http://puppetconf.com/). And, I'm advising a good friend on her first business, and another on opening up data at a big company. 

Looking forward -- I'd love to hear what you all are working on, and a chance to catch up over a beer or coffee in the next month. I am looking for a new thing to do, but taking my time. 

Plus -- it's summer. Scott and I have done some major work on the yard, and have parties and movie viewings planned until the pond freezes over. 

You're totally invited.
