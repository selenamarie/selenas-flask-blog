We're looking for a few good OPML files!

Tell us where you go to find information about tech in Portland!  I'm interested in software companies, non-profits, developer blogs and culture resources that are relevant to tech businesses. Off the top of my head: [Silicon Florist](http://www.siliconflorist.com), [Mark Rogoway's blog](http://blog.oregonlive.com/siliconforest/index.html), [BikePortland](http://bikeportland.org) and [Sarah Mirk's twitter feed](http://twitter.com/sarahmirk) all are relevant. [Urban Airship](http://urbanairship.com), [Puppet Labs](http://puppetlabs.com), [Bank Simple](http://banksimple.com), [Small Society](http://smallsociety.com/) and [Cloud Four](http://cloudfour.com) are all local businesses and startups I'm keeping an eye on.

And what will I do with your contributions? I'm going to pick the best-of and curate a feed for the pdx11.org site.

Let me know what's in your feed reader below!
