[PDXPUG](http://pugs.postgresql.org/pdx) and [USPgA](http://postgresql.us) are headed to LinuxFest NW in Bellingham, WA this weekend. We have a booth we'll be staffing 9:30AM-5:00PM Saturday and 9:30AM-4:00PM Sunday. Mark Wong will be presenting [ptop](http://ptop.projects.postgresql.org) Saturday April 26th, at 10am in room Haskell-111\. Don't miss it!

Seems like a [great lineup](http://blug.org/fest2008/schedule.dxp) this year - tons of Drupal, how to use open source in your business, and ROBOTS!

Come meet us and find out more about PostgreSQL.
