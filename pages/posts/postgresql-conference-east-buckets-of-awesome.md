We're gearing up for [PostgreSQL Conference East](http://www.postgresqlconference.org)!

Slides are coming in, food's been ordered, and we're working out the final details of the space and recording.  One of our committee members has a few digital cameras, so we're hoping to record video in all three rooms. 

Reading through the slides, I'm very excited to see Portland-local Jeff Davis' talks on his work with the [Ruby PostgreSQL driver](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/talks_pages/talk25.html), and a more general talk on [Logic and Databases](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/talks_pages/talk28.html). Jeff has been a fixture at PDXPUG, and I'm happy he's able to come out for the conference. 

David Fetter is giving a crowd favorite, [A Flock of PLs](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/talks_pages/talk20.html). And Michael Bryzek looks to be giving an [simple and elegant talk](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/talks_pages/talk16.html) explaining how to solve a common queuing problem for web application developers. 

If you're from the DC area, please suggest fun things to do while we're in town (May 29-30). Especially good places to eat near the University of Maryland at College Park.
