The following email just dropped into my inbox, and I had to share. Keith is a fixture in the Portland tech community - running [Linux clinics](http://www.pdxlinux.org/) (scroll down the page for info), volunteering at [FreeGeek](http://freegeek.org), attending user group meetings and occasionally presenting. 

He's got this crazy idea - **provide computing services from orbit**. It involves ultralight discs of silicon, solar sails and launching "stuff" into orbit from a really long rail line.. and, well, some other completely awesome ideas. Keith set up a [wiki](http://server-sky.com/ServerSky), and there are [great volunteer opportunities](http://server-sky.com/NavigationV01) sprinkled throughout it, like "Study and simulate the trajectory and recovery of a tumbling server-sat in detail."  Seriously.

If you've got some time tomorrow, you should go check it out, have a beer at Roots and mingle with the Personal Telco folks, who are amazing for creating a completely free, volunteer-driven wireless network throughout Portland.
