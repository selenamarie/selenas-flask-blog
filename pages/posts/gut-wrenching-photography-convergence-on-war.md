If you haven't seen [this Nina Berman slideshow](http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2007/08/21/arts/20070822_BERMAN_SLIDESHOW_index.html), go there now.

You can also read the [NY Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/22/arts/design/22berm.html?ex=1345435200&en=c3a944623cb47444&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss) about her work on this project. I've subscribed to [Jen Beckman's blog](http://www.personism.com/) for a while now, and been blown away by the photographers she curates.

I was impressed with the access that Ms. Berman had to her subjects. The soldiers reminded me of the men in [No End In Sight](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0912593/). I saw that at Cinema21 just a week ago. It is the best war documentary I've seen about Iraq. Far better than Fahrenheit 911\. I've been re-visiting 9/11 stuff - I picked up the [Illustrated 9/11 Commission's Report](http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/56603/graphic_novels_take_a_huge_step_forward.html) that I bought nearly a year ago and read it cover to cover.

And did you know that [Errol Morris](http://morris.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/15/will-the-real-hooded-man-please-stand-up/) had a blog?
> When I was a little boy I asked my older brother, If you blow up a photograph can you eventually see atoms? Here is one answer. When you magnify a leaf, in principle, you get down to the atomic level of the leaf. But when you magnify a photograph of a leaf, you get down to the atomic level of the photograph. You can keep magnifying the grains of silver-halide and get down to the atomic level of the silver-halide, but you do not see additional detail of the leaf. As a result of this inherent limitation, photographs are nothing more than coarse-grained screens laid over reality, revealing nothing more (about what is photographed) than a certain size. They provide an imperfect simulacrum of the surface of things.

> Photography presents things and at the same time hides things from our view. It allows us to not-see at the same time that it allows us to see. But language plus photography provides an express train to error.
My media consumption is converging on war these days.
