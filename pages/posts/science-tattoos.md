I came across this [photo set of science tattoos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/carlzimmer/1074255076/in/set-72157601351535771/) today (via [The Loom science blog](http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2007/08/06/branded_with_science.php)). The [fibonacci sequence implemented in scheme](http://www.flickr.com/photos/carlzimmer/1072758937/in/set-72157601351535771/) was bizarre, and there was a poignant one about being a [celiac](http://www.flickr.com/photos/carlzimmer/1073128333/in/set-72157601351535771/). They reminded me of [these rsa key tattoos](http://www.cypherspace.org/adam/rsa/) (search for 'tattoo'). And [some guy](http://www.livingadspace.com/) that puts web ads on his body.  He ended up on Conan, CNN, NBC and got interviewed by USA Today in 2005\. He added three more tattoos this year.

I have this design idea rattling around in my head - that there's partially an advertising design root-cause in of a generation of people compulsively tattooing themselves with weird shit. Like we're seeing the results of extreme brand-consciousness, and the feeling that we all just need to be a little bit more unique than the next person, or that our ideas and interests need to be quickly externalized and etched into our skin.

There's beauty in the photos of the web-banner tattoos - the saturated colors, the raised/bruised skin, the skin itself. Its hard not to feel a bit of the being-tattooed adrenaline rush when looking at the finished products, just moments after the needle stops. But, they're still ugly.
