[This paper](http://precedings.nature.com/documents/579/version/1) was added to the Nature Precedings site today.  

The title grabbed my attention - "The saltational model for the dawn of H. sapiens, chin, adolescence phase, complex language and modern behavior". Ok, I'll admit that it was those [Jean Auel](http://www.randomhouse.com/crown/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780609610978) books (in 9th grade) that sparked my interest in non-fiction about the origins of our species. 

So, first I had to look up [saltation](http://www.answers.com/topic/saltation-biology) - it basically means "a sudden change". Kind of tipped me off for what was to come.

And then page 3:

I already gave away the punchline in the title, but I'll be painfully clear: the paper was a poorly written intelligent design argument, thinly disguised as a research paper on ancient skeletal remains. 

I've seen [Journey of Man](http://www.shoppbs.org/sm-pbs-journey-of-man-dvd--pi-1402989.html), so I was interested in how the paper might get around the genetic evidence.. and well, the paper was unintelligible. There was a bunch of handwaving about different pieces of different ancient bones, and comparing them. Maybe dwTheory can tell me what grains of truth might have been mixed in with all the crap.

After wading through all the junk, I decided to find out who one of the co-authors, Omer Faruk Noyan, is. A google search turned up [this](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&id=660) petition questioning the validity of Darwinism. 

I did learn from google that 'saltational' is a word often used by creationists. Maybe because is sounds scientifical?  Rather than saying "hey, I think God did it!", it is much better to use a word most people won't know. Because that's what science is about - using big words to construct nonsense arguments.
