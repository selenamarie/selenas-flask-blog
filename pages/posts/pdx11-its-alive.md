Alright,[ PDX11 is alive](http://pdx11.org)!

Tonight's the big software summit!  If you didn't already sign up, it's going to be live streamed, and I'm sure there will be tons of tweets and blog posts after.  PDX11 will have followup information, and announcements related to the next steps each group involved will be taking. 

If you want to get a head start -- sign up for the mailing lists!

For announcements: [http://lists.pdx11.org/mailman/listinfo/pdx11-announce](http://lists.pdx11.org/mailman/listinfo/pdx11-announce)
