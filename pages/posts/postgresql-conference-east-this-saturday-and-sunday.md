We're wrapping up all the little details for the conference: 

*   Wireless access is secured!  Each person will have their own account. You'll  receive it when you register.
*   Our [final schedule](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/pdfs/schedule_east08.pdf) is available!
*   The last few talks have been rolling in. I'm very excited about the round table Sunday morning with Joshua Drake (USPA and PostgreSQL SPI Liaison), Bruce Momjian (PostgreSQL Core) and Magnus Hagander (PostgreSQL-EU). Bring some questions!  We'll be on IRC taking remote questions as well.
*   I'll be giving a talk on [ptop](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/talks_pages/talk44.html) Sunday too!
*   Also very excited to get together with other Women In Open Source!

We're all getting together at the Greenbelt Chevy's on Friday night. Let me know if you'd like to join. I've made a reservation for 20\.
