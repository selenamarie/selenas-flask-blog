I've been watching the Nature Precedings feed..

[http://precedings.nature.com/documents/425/version/1](http://precedings.nature.com/documents/425/version/1 "Examining the uses of shared data")

The researchers studied re-used vs. original data in publications containing the word "microarray". The Odds Ratio by Disease graph pointed toward greater reuse in Leukemia and Nutritional/Metabolic Diseases. Maybe because those diseases have been studied much longer? Or the scientists who study those diseases use the public resources more? I imagine there's funding priorities and areas of research that are thought to be more promising than others. I'd love to see a follow up that explored the whys.
