This will be a series of blog posts about the reading I'm doing about feminism. 

Over the years, I've been given a list of books like the [The Feminine Mystique](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393322572/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0393322572&linkCode=as2&tag=tendthegard-20)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tendthegard-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0393322572), [The Second Sex (Vintage)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030727778X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=030727778X&linkCode=as2&tag=tendthegard-20)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tendthegard-20&l=as2&o=1&a=030727778X), and most recently [Fire with Fire: The New Female Power and How to Use It](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0449909514/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0449909514&linkCode=as2&tag=tendthegard-20)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tendthegard-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0449909514). 

I've read parts or all of those, and many other books. But I am still sitting here with a profound sense of dislocation about feminism. I don't have a list of feminist philosophers or writers that I strongly identify with. I find a lot of the writing either polemical or overly academic. I would like to find the books and articles that I can identify with, learn from and share.

My first action is to [create a wiki page with links to books and articles](http://selenamarie.fed.wiki.org/view/welcome-visitors/view/feminist-reading-list) that I'm finding in a number of syllabi for introductory womens studies classes. 

If you have a syllabus from a course you've taken that you can share with me, I'd love to see it.

The things I've read today include: 

*   [The Agony of Feminism: Why Feminist Theory Is Necessary After All, Nina Baym](http://www.english.illinois.edu/-people-/emeritus/baym/essays/feminism.htm)
*   [Doing Gender](http://www.soc.washington.edu/users/brines/doinggender.pdf), [Doing Gender Reflection](http://selenamarie.fed.wiki.org/view/welcome-visitors/view/feminist-reading-list/view/doing-gender-reflection)
*   [If men could menstruate](http://www.haverford.edu/psych/ddavis/p109g/steinem.menstruate.html), Gloria Steinem
*   [White Privilege: Unpacking the invisible backpack](http://www.amptoons.com/blog/files/mcintosh.html), Peggy McIntosh

I am [reflecting on all the readings](http://selenamarie.fed.wiki.org/view/welcome-visitors/view/feminist-reading-list/view/feminist-reading-reflections), and if you'd like to join me in discussion, I'd love to have some discussion partners as I work through these texts.
