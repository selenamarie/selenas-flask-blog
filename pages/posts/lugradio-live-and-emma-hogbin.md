I drove down to San Francisco yesterday with my co-presenter [Andy](http://www.thesethingsmattertome.com) for [LugRadio Live USA 2008](http://lugradio.org/live/USA2008/).  Between presenting and booth duty, I was able to see [Matthew Garrett](http://mjg59.livejournal.com/) give a fantastic talk about laptops and power management (and all the things that go wrong!), and [Emma Hogbin](http://emmajane.net/) give her talk, "Form an orderly queue, ladies."

I really enjoyed Emma's presentation, and especially was impressed that women attendees made up more than half of her [HICK Tech](http://www.hicktech.com/) conference. It was an unexpected, and really inspiring achievement. She also mentioned [geekspeakr.com](http://geekspeakr.com), a great new service that [Brenda Wallace](http://coffee.geek.nz) set up for cataloging women speakers. I can't wait for her talk at OSCON.

One of her main points was that increasing the number of female speakers at conferences - regardless of their marketability (my words, not hers) or geek-cred - was the key to increasing female attendance.  Later on, she mentioned that she also had enlisted the help of a couple key matriarchs in the community to help ensure the participation from the community. Conference organizers should pay attention to what she's done. 

She knits. And she sews. With [fabric](http://emmajane.net/node/735) that I love.  So much that I made a pillowcase out using a piece of it:

I even made that pink piping myself!

This evening I had a great dinner at Out the Door in the Westfield center, and then spent a few hours hanging out at the Google after-party. Had a lovely evening.  Finally time for a good night's sleep!
