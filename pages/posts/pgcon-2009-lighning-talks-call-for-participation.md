Can you believe it? [PgCon 2009](http://pgcon.org) is nearly here!

We need lightning talks for our Lightning Talks session at PgCon in Ottawa, Ontario next week!  

I have a few talks lined up (there's really only time for about 10 of them!), but we need MORE!  Lightning talks are FIVE MINUTE presentations.  If you've never given a talk before, this is a great way to get your feet wet.  If you have a last minute awesome thing to share, now is your time to do it!

Anything PostgreSQL related - code, stories, announcements -- just send your topics to me! Comment below or email me: selena -at- postgresql -dot- org.

I'll post talks as they are confirmed here: [http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PgCon_2009_Lightning_talks](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PgCon_2009_Lightning_talks)

Hope to see you at PgCon!
