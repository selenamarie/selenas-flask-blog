Saturday night, February 9, at 8pm, Richard Broersma and a crew of 15 launched LAPUG.  Noel Proffitt, from the City of Garden Grove, gave a great talk on time-oriented (or temporal) database design. 

He presented an example of a set of columns, rules and triggers for tracking both valid and transaction time. Noel also was kind enough to give a plug to the temporal data type that Jeff Davis and I presented last PGDay before OSCON.  There was some suggestion that Jeff should submit the code for version 8.4\.  

We also showed off the new PUGs website, and talked a little about what had brought people to the BoF. 

A few students from Cal Poly were there, along with many experienced administrators from around LA. Richard mentioned that his company was willing to host the groupâ€™s first meeting, and Noel offered to bring a projector. The group also asked about potential topics, so I am going to start a talks repository on the [PUGs](http://pugs.postgresql.org) site. Ultimately, Iâ€™d love to have the authoritative and searchable repository of PostgreSQL talks for all PUGs to use as starting points and references. 

Thanks go to Robert Broersma for taking the initiative and [announcing the meeting](http://pugs.postgresql.org/node/150), and [Joshua Drake](www.commandprompt.com/blogs/joshua_drake/) for scheduling the BoF. Also, it was a pleasure to spend the weekend with Joshua, Robert, [David Fetter](http://fetter.org/) and [Josh Berkus](http://www.ittoolbox.com/profiles/josh_berkus) in the SCaLE PostgreSQL booth.

Iâ€™m looking forward to great meetings from LAPUG in the future!
