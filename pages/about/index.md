## About photos on the site

Anything unattributed is a photo my husband has or I have taken. Most of them are up on my flickr site. I shoot with a Nikon D40 (currently out of commission), an Cannon Elph, an iPhone 3G, a Droid 3 or a 30+ year old Fujica film camera.

## About chesnok

'chesnok' means garlic in russian. I studied Russian for two years in college. I was obsessed with Marina Tsvetaeva, Anna Akhmatova and Osip Mandelstam. My accent is terrible, and I can only barely read simple Russian anymore.
