## Writing

Selena tends to write about things like: [women in Open Source](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/womenintech/2007/09/28/to-sir-with-love-how-to-get-more-women-involved-in-open-source.html), [Open Source World Domination](http://opensourcebridge.org/2009/03/open-source-world-domination-part-i/), and [features that make PostgreSQL rock](http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid39_gci1351721,00.html). She likes writing, generally. And can usually be convinced to write about things she's up to. She also likes to draw [monkeys](http://www.flickr.com/photos/selenamarie/sets/72157623591946477/). And [Postgres](/daily/postgres/). She's a contributing writer for the [Google Summer of Code Mentor Manual](http://www.booki.cc/gsoc-mentoring/), and [Student Guide](http://www.booki.cc/gsocstudentguide/).

## About photos on the site

Anything unattributed is a photo my husband has or I have taken. Most of them are up on my flickr site. I shoot with a Nikon D40 (currently out of commission), an Cannon Elph, an iPhone 3G, a Droid 3 or a 30+ year old Fujica film camera.

## About chesnok

'chesnok' means garlic in russian. I studied Russian for two years in college. I was obsessed with Marina Tsvetaeva, Anna Akhmatova and Osip Mandelstam. My accent is terrible, and I can only barely read simple Russian anymore.
